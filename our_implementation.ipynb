    "\n",
    "In this section, we will **map and standardize** the `admin_code` and `admin_name` fields to their corresponding **district, province, and country names**. This step is **crucial** for ensuring **consistency** across different datasets and enabling **accurate aggregations** at multiple administrative levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "🛠 **Why is Admin Level Mapping Important?**\n",
    "✅ Different datasets may use **slightly different spellings or formats** for district names.  \n",
    "✅ Some district names might be **missing or misspelled**, requiring standardization.  \n",
    "✅ We need to **match and align** district names across various sources before aggregating at **province and country levels**.  \n",
    "✅ Proper mapping allows us to **merge datasets correctly** without losing information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Steps in Admin Mapping**\n",
    "1️⃣ **Load the `matching_districts.csv` file**, which provides the mapping between different district name variations.  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Identify missing or unmatched `admin_name` values** and find their closest matches using fuzzy matching techniques.  \n",
    "3️⃣ **Ensure that each `admin_code` uniquely maps to one `district`, `province`, and `country`.**  \n",
    "4️⃣ **Replace inconsistent names** in the dataset with their standardized versions.  \n",
    "5️⃣ **Aggregate data at the `province` and `country` levels** after ensuring all districts are correctly mapped.  \n"
