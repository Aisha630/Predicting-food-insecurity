He also prayed that the world faced the economic, political and law and order crisis in 2022, there was a positive progress to overcome them in the New Year, the new year proved to be the end of hunger, war, terrorism, crime, sectarianism and class division from all over the world, including Pakistan. He said that last year, the patriots faced many difficulties. In the wider interest of Pakistan's economy and the people, when we took the constitutional path, the country tried to create a constitutional crisis and chaos. The Prime Minister said that in the meantime, climate change caused the worst flood situation in the country which left hundreds of people dead, injured thousands, more than 300 million people were affected by it and financially developing country like Pakistan suffered $ 30 billion. He said that I monitored the help of flood victims, as a servant of Pakistan and tried to reduce their pain by going to the people in grief, every official of the coalition government, including me, called for flood victims in every corner of the world. On the other hand, former Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan described 2022 as the best and worst. In his statement on Twitter, he said that the year 2022 was simultaneously and the worst, in personal interest, a conspiracy was removed by a conspiracy to show the best economic performance and Pakistan was handed over to a group of criminals. He said that the group kissed the economy, gave itself NRO 2 and opened the door to looting for all white -collar criminals through amendments to NAB law. He said that this year was excellent that in the meantime I saw the people of Pakistan in the mold of a nation, with the full backing of the Election Commission and the power of all the political parties of the country, despite the unity of all the political parties of the country. The former Prime Minister said that nowadays, despite the disappointment of the national scenario, especially due to the disappointment of bankruptcy, I believe in the Lord and my people that the PTI will undoubtedly establish a strong government through elections in 2023 and Pakistan will be promoted by the government and its country. He said that solid structure reforms would be made to get Pakistan out of the crisis. Imported government and its supporters have put the country in a crisis. Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari declared the year 2022 as a historic year due to the abolition of Imran Khan's government as a result of a successful movement, in which the elected parliament won against the selected Hakran by the votes of the people. Bilawal Bhutto, a statement issued on Twitter, said, \"We are united to save Pakistan. They will be a year of victory and hope for unity against 2023 hatred, truth and division against falsehood.\" Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Information and Information Maryam Aurangzeb congratulated the nation on the New Year and said that 2023 should be the Naveed Bihar of happiness, development and prosperity, the youth should find the destination of dreams and broken hearts. In one of his tweets, the Federal Minister said that the new year is a blessing, may God give the wounds of humanity to the wounds of humanity, inflation, terrorism, injustice, injustice, lies and hatred. Federal Minister for Information said that the nave of happiness, development and prosperity should be spring, young people have dreams, get broken hearts, get sick health, end unrest and promote peace. In another tweet, Mary Aurangzeb reacted strongly to Imran Khan's statement, criticizing the former Prime Minister. He said that the person imprisoned in his own self does not think ahead, nor does anyone think of the grief, nor does anyone have a sense of happiness, who does not have to share the happiness and sorrow of the happiness of others."

         "In a decade for security personnel in Pakistan, the year ended 2022 with the deadliest month, with a new wave of terrorist activities containing the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and ISIS-Afghanistan. According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, a report released by the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) states that Pakistan is likely to face more violent incidents in 2023. In 2022, at least 282 security personnel were martyred, of which 40 were martyred during the December attacks alone, including the improvised bombing (IED) attacks, suicide attacks and most of the attacks on security posts in Pak-Afghan border areas. During 2022, Pakistan faced 376 terrorist attacks, banned terrorist organizations like TTP, ISIS and BLA claimed responsibility for 57 attacks, the total number of casualties as a result of terrorist incidents was 973. Overall, violent incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa increased extraordinarily, where the number of casualties increased by 108 %. As a result of these incidents, 62 percent of the martyrdom occurred by civilians, government officials and security personnel, while the remaining 38 percent of the casualties killed militants, rebels and others involved in illegal activities. The report states that such an unusual series of terrorism began in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan shortly after the banned TTP announced the end of the war, which resulted in more than 2 dozen attacks in December alone. As a result, the mortality rate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has increased by about 64 % of the total deaths resulting from terrorism in the country, followed by 26 % of the deaths belonging to Balochistan. Authorities claim that most of the incidents of terrorism are found in eastern Afghanistan, where Afghan Taliban of TTP leading militants are hospitalizing. The Afghan Taliban resurrected the issue of the Durand Line, raising questions on a border fence costing $ 50 million, as well as being destroyed. Most of the terrorist attacks were focused in Bannu, adjacent to Waziristan, Bajaur and Kurram districts, these districts are directly adjacent to Afghan provinces, Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktia, Paktika, which is why these areas are used to enter Pakistani territory for terrorist purposes. In 2023, further incidents of terrorism are being raised in Pakistan. The incidents that have taken place over the past decade apparently suggest that security forces (including the army and the police), including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, will remain under terrorism, while the challenges will remain in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies also shows that the highest militant attacks in Pakistan in the last 5 years took place in 2022, increased by 28 % and 35 %, with 2021, and 35 %, respectively. During the year 2022, Pakistan suffered nearly 376 terrorist attacks, with 533 deaths and 832 injured. It should be noted that this was the first time since 2017 when more than 300 militants faced attacks in Pakistan in one year."

         "In the scorching sun of Karachi, Qari Zainuddin and his daughter are patiently standing outside Amin House, which has been transformed from a hostel to detention center. In the streets of Sultanabad, the two father and daughter are among about a dozen policemen who are protecting the building, where the city has been in different areas. The father, who is a small tall man, is dressed in a shalwar shirt and a white hat, holds a file firmly in his hand. The girl, whose face is hidden in the veil, is carrying a heavy bag, weighing her 18 -year -old delicate waist. Both are drunk in sweat but are quietly waiting for their turn. When the area's station house officer appears, they immediately run to him, then they are asked to wait more. Zainuddin, an Afghan refugee, came to Pakistan in 1996 when he was a commission. Initially, the Hazara division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was based in Karachi, then moved to Karachi, where he was married. Bibi Raza, who is with him, was born in Karachi and was recently married here but on the third day of Eid, her husband was arrested from a non -shop in Banaras, Orangi Town. Zainuddin said his son -in -law POR (Proof of Residency) had lost cards, so he was arrested. On that day, Zainuddin visited the police station in the area several times, and he was told that Kamaluddin had been sent to Amin House. He points to the file, saying that 'I have come here with all the documents, it contains Razia BB's POR card, marriage contract, birth certificate and vaccination cards'. \"I have a request, either release my son -in -law or take my daughter so that the two can go with Afghanistan, what will she do here alone?\" Zainuddin cries. \"I will wait all day, but unless I get a final answer, I will not leave here.\" And thus Zainuddin stands outside Amin House until a policeman gives them a place to sit. Qari Zainuddin and his daughter are waiting outside Amin House. In recent days, hundreds of Afghans have returned to Afghanistan from the Torkham and Chaman border as the government launched its second deportation program on March 31, targeting Afghan citizen cards, which is an identity document that was jointly released by the Pakistani and Afghan government in 2017. The campaign is part of a major project that the government started in 2023 to send all illegal foreigners back. In the first phase, all non -documentary Afghans were deported, who were not identified. In Karachi, in the past five days, at least 307 Afghan refugees, especially those who have an Afghan Citizen Card (ACC), have been repatriated, according to a temporary police statement that Dawn.com is available. In addition, 11,272 Afghans have been repatriated from April 1 via the Khum border. In 2017, Pakistan, along with the Afghan government, introduced Afghan citizen cards, which were issued to those who could not get POR cards for some reason. The number of ACC holders is about 8 million 40 thousand. The Afghans who crossed the border not only left their homes and property but also left their family members behind. On the other hand, those who are on this side are in a state of constant fear and anxiety. An hour away from Amin House, fear is clearly felt in the streets of the Afghan settlement. Which is a 40 -year -old settlement in the outskirts of Karachi. The road leading to the camp is almost deserted, except for the trucks filled. But inside, the first symbol of life is seen in the narrow and uneven streets, the young boys are gathered around the fossil ball table, the children are running barefoot, a newly built mosque, freshly bursting clutch and scent of squeeze kebab. There are clutches outside the hotel in the Afghan settlement of Karachi. \"Here we are safe,\" says the Afghan township resident and tailor Ibadullah. \"Most of us have not stepped out here for the past week for fear of arrest.\" A few days ago, a crackdown on the town shook them and their neighbors. \"Law enforcement personnel entered our homes and arrested people without checking the ID card,\" he explains. A similar incident took place on Thursday in Alif Square and Sohrab Goth, near the same area, which is 23 minutes away from the town, where most Afghan men come for work. Police conducted raids and continued their arrests. 'They say we are living here illegally, we are born here and play, then how can we be illegal? These POR cards were given to us by the government. ' Ibad Allah says and shows his card and shows it. \"If we were illegal, why did they give us these cards?\" POR cards were introduced in collaboration with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and between 2006 and 2007, 21 million 50 thousand Afghan refugees were issued. These cards were valid for two years, after which they renew every two years. Under this program, refugees had benefits such as opening a bank account, getting jobs and getting education. According to Advocate Maniza Kakar, the deadline for deportation for the POR card holders by the government is June 30. Maniza Kakar is a lawyer and founding member of the Joint Action Committee for Refugee. He claims that arrests are a trick to make money. \"If you give them money, they will leave you, if not, they will grab you and send you the detention center,\" said a angry -filled worship. 'What else do we have? This is a conflict between hiding and exile. ”For some, it is a war between life and death. Gul Alam, a neighbor of Ibadullah, who stands silent. It has been difficult to walk or stand longer in recent times. Being a kidney patient, he has to go to Dr. Ruth Fau Civil Hospital every week but has not left his home for two weeks. Ibadullah and other Afghan settlements are gathered. \"I have nine children, most of whom are daughters. What will she do if I was deported?\" Nearly a young girl looks at the curtain and brings a bullet with water for her father. \"He doesn't even know what Afghanistan is or where,\" Gul Alam, 55, says his daughter. Most of the Afghan settlements have POR cards, which means they are not yet being deported. But it does not diminish their fear or anxiety. Gul Alam said, \"When they come, they do not ask for cards, they just come with sticks and oppression, they have forced so many families to leave the town and hide.\" Afghan refugees who refer to raids and crackdowns examples of the 2023 campaign when the campaign for the first time began. But Saeed Hussain, who is an anthropologist, who is a Pashtun migration in Karachi, makes it clear that these steps have now intensified. \"They are raiding houses and plazas after 12 o'clock in the night, and are only raising people on suspicion that they look Afghan and once they are arrested, they are not sent to the magistrate as they should be given a legal process, but they are sent to Amin House, where they are sent to Amin House.\" It was formally established as an Afghan detention center, but Saeed calls it \"black holes\" because neither lawyers nor anyone else is allowed to enter. \"We do not know how many Afghans are there, what their condition is, or how they are being treated,\" he added, \"We do not even know that those who are being arrested and brought to the hostel have ACC permits or POR cards.\" Afghan refugees whose families were sent to the hostel were similar. An elderly resident of the Afghan settlement, who said on condition of anonymity, said, \"My nephew is in the detention center and is sending us videos, there are about 50 to 70 people being stuck in a room, it is extremely heat, and they are being given food only once a day. Hundreds of people are forced to use the same bathroom. ”Dawn.com also visited Amin House but was not allowed to enter. The hostel is located near the Haji camp near the Rangers headquarters. There are no clear marks of the detention center, which were present in accordance with Saeed but have recently been removed. Only at night's activities suggest that something is happening inside. According to DIG South Asad Raza, the hostel is a shelter where accommodation and food are provided. NADRA and FIA teams are at the center for verification. \"If an Afghan, who has a POR card, is brought here, will be handed over to the relevant police station after confirming NADRA's database,\" he said. Rather, they have been given the task of arresting and deporting those who are not going to voluntarily. 'He made it clear that in the event of an arrest,' if any illegal Afghan arrest can be presented in court under an illegal foreign act and then the Chaman border can be sent to the border to be deported. He was also detained, resulting in a dispute. \"But the purpose of our work is to send them back with respect and respect.\" Meanwhile, refugees are being verified and biometric scanning at Amin House, which is done by NADRA and FIA teams. These scans are used to produce a list or a \"manfest document\", as it says. It includes refugees' names, ID cards, pictures, age, gender and the border through which they have to be sent to Afghanistan. Once the document is ready, refugees are filled in buses and taken to the Chaman border by Jacobabad. On Sunday morning, a convoy of six buses in which a security charge contains a security charge, departed from Amin House and left the Malir Expressway to Karachi-Hyderabad motorway. Outside a shop in an Afghan settlement, the elderly and children in the protection of 8 police mobiles, these buses stop at the same type of detention center in Jacobabad, then head to Chaman, which is 6 hours away. At the border, the \"minor document\" is shared with UNHCR and Afghan government officials. These moments for refugees are their last in Pakistan, before they enter a country from which they or their parents fled here. According to Saeed, who is also a member of the Joint Action Committee for Refugee, once crossing the border, it is very difficult to contact his family. \"Because now these people are viewed with suspicion from both border officials.\" He added that the Taliban government has also said that they cannot take all refugees. 'So what will happen to these people? You have expelled them from a country and sent them to a place that they do not want. ”Boys in the Afghan town are playing fossa ball, UNHCR spokesman Qasim Khan also expressed similar concern while talking to Dawn.com. \"It is important that the return of Afghan refugees be volunteer and dignified so that their resettlement in Afghanistan can be sustained,\" he said. He requested that Pakistan see his condition from a human point of view, he also emphasized the need for dialogue between Islamabad and Kabul. He adds that the agency is talking to the government about the arrest of Afghan refugees, and lawyers are working to release those who are seeking refuge and keeping POR cards. Hundreds of miles away from the Chaman border, the Afghan settlement residents hide their fear, anxiety, anger and hatred under a hope. One of them is Zia -ul -Haq, who is a general store operating in the area, with the flag hoisting Pakistan's flag on the roof. The walls of their shop are written in Urdu in Urdu. \"My father came to Karachi in the 1980s and he named my name in the name of the then military dictator,\" he said, \"he said proudly. \"I named my son Ijaz -ul -Haq to continue this tradition.\" He says that his father started a business here in the Afghan settlement and died for a long time. \"I was born here and grown ... My children were born here and grew up ... My parents and grandparents are buried here ... My country is Pakistan and just Pakistan.\" They shout \"John Janpakistan, Dil Dilpakistan,\" \"We hope and pray that the government should see our love for this country and let us know here.\" Then they ask a worker standing nearby: 'All will be fine?' Zia -ul -Haq has not been able to go to the market and buy his shop again. Reason? Fear again. \"If they arrest me or ask for a bribe?\" Similarly, many other shopkeepers in the area are making the last priority to leave the Afghan settlement, though their luggage is decreasing. But where men are scared, 65 -year -old Ziba is ready to tolerate it. She was only 25 years old when she came to Karachi with her husband and milk. He said, 'I have spent 40 years here, how can I leave? And where will I go? ”There is a swing in front of them in which their grandson is blinking, a rocky blanket is placed on it. \"I don't remember the name of my village or the people living there ... Who is waiting for me?\" Ziba laughed and says, \"My tongue has now changed.\" Ziba, 65, is in the house of a room in an Afghan settlement soon his son, Muhammad Rasool, arrives, who is a driver. \"I had recently gone to Afghanistan,\" he tells Dawn.com. ; Do you know that there are left -handed vehicles? How will I work there? If my work is finished here, I will find someone else, but no one knows me there. ”He says, taking out his POR card. 'This is my identity card, no matter what anyone says. Ziba is also irritated. She says, 'I will not go unless they put me on the bus. One of them is wearing a green and white hat on which a star is connected. All the pictures were made by the writer.

         "The system of life has been suspended in Balochistan for the past several weeks, with most of the highways connecting the province to other parts of the country, while mobile phone services have been suspended. Quetta, which is the provincial capital, is almost locked up and the administration is trying to prevent protesters from entering the city, led by Akhtar Mengal. In such a situation, the sovereignty of the state seems to be completely abolished. Even leaders like Akhtar Mengal and other Baloch nationalists who were once considered to be the last connection between the people and the state, now it seems that their trust in the political process is losing. The former provincial chief minister, who is the head of the Balochistan National Party (BNP) faction, has resigned from the parliament a few months ago and has attributed the apathy of the parliament to the 'insecurity' facing the people of Balochistan. He recently returned from the UAE, where he was living after his resignation from Parliament, and after the recent wave of terrorism and extremism in Balochistan, he is leading the 'Long March' against the arrest of the Baloch Solidarity Committee (BYC) leaders. The march is now joined with several other nationalist parties and central political parties. The growing public anger against state abuses has persuaded Baloch youth to support extremist groups. This disturbing trend can make nationalist parties completely irrelevant. In such a situation, the state will not have anything to do. But there is no understanding of the seriousness of the situation in the routes of power in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Instead, we are witnessing the increasing use of force to silence the sounds, and they are being forced to abandon the democratic path. In the context of growing violence and terrorism by militants, the crackdown against political opposition has made the province's situation very unpredictable. A broken provincial government, whose legal status is also questioned, has completely failed. It is evident that the real power is with the establishment, which only sees the situation with the 'security lens'. This has been a major reason for the people of the state to lose their hearts and minds. It certainly provides terrorist groups to work with more immunity. The recent wave of high -profile terrorist attacks across the province is also evidence of losing control of the state. According to some reports, 20 districts of the province are now influenced by the violence and political violence of the militants. The abolition of the administration has worsened the situation. According to reports, some ministers of the provincial cabinet cannot go to their constituencies despite heavy security. The recent hijacking of a passenger train and simultaneous terrorist attacks in different parts of the province clarify the growing capabilities of militant groups. This would not have been possible without local cooperation. The crackdown by security forces provides more recruits to these groups. The growing involvement of female fighters has made Baloch militancy more deadly. There have been many incidents of terrorist attacks by women suicide bombers, especially on security targets. Women are also leading the rights movement. For example, many people see Dr. Mahi Rang Baloch as the Right Movement as a torch path. Most women who are now leading the rights movement have their own stories that their families are suffering from state repression. The emergence of a new generation of young and educated Baloch resistance leadership has made the old guard politically irrelevant. The state now has to deal with them. But it seems that the province has no understanding of the rapidly changing political scenario. What is happening in Balochistan is the result of decades of state mismanagement, ignoring and depriving people of their basic political and economic rights. Increasing alienation and increasing separation, militant violence seems to be a reaction to the colonial methods and mentality of our ruling elite and the establishment. Security forces face the fifth Baloch uprising. Earlier in 1948, 59-1958, 63-1962, and 77-1973 there were four uprising. But this time the rebels appear to be more ready and they have the latest weapons and modern communication systems. After the last uprising, the province remained relatively stable and as a result of the restoration of democracy in 1988, the Baloch nationalists came into the mainstream. Although many of his demands regarding natural gas royalty and the province's natural resources were not met, democratic rule gave the Baloch a sense of political participation. The tensions began to rise in 2003 when the Musharraf government announced the plan for three new camps in the province. This idea did not go well with local political forces. The increasing deployment of security personnel further dissatisfied. In Balochistan, even the maintenance of law and order is mostly with the federally -controlled paramilitary forces. It has worsened the situation in addition to other matters. Even the present provincial government, which has been supported by the establishment, has no real power. There was also an idea that increasing terrorism and protests would be taken as a 'wake -up call' and would force the federal government and the establishment to sit with nationalist leaders and seek political solutions, but that did not happen. Instead, the government has set up a \"tough state\" committee headed by the Federal Home Minister. Now it is difficult to understand what it means. There are many questions about what the 'hard state' real means. The state can only be strengthened when the causes of people's dissatisfaction are eliminated, not to show. We can only hope to make better decisions, it is too late before it is. Read this post in English."

         "The National Security Committee meeting reaffirmed its commitment to not tolerate terrorism in Pakistan, and reiterated the commitment to spread tensions with all organizations with full force. In a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office after the National Security Committee, the 40th meeting of the National Security Committee was chaired by Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, attended by the concerned federal ministers, the chiefs of the Armed Forces and the heads of intelligence agencies. The statement said that the concept of 'national security' embraces economic security and that it is suppressed at national sovereignty and dignity without economic self -sufficiency or sovereignty. The meeting was informed that the meeting reviewed the country's economic situation and the challenges in a comprehensive manner that was especially faced by the people belonging to Pakistan's low income and middle class. The Federal Finance Minister gave the meeting a briefing on the Roadmap of Economic Stability, including the status of negotiations with global financial institutions, as well as a briefing on finding other financial sources based on mutual interest and providing relief to the public. A statement from the Prime Minister's Office said that the National Security Committee has agreed to concrete steps to strengthen the economy, which includes the importation of imports and illegal withdrawal of currency and preventing handicrafts. According to the statement, the meeting agreed that focus would be on improving agricultural and industrial production, especially to ensure food protection. In addition, alternative imports and employment opportunities will also be ensured. It was further agreed that it would be a priority to make public -friendly policies that would benefit the common man. It was further stated that it was also agreed to include all stakeholders to create a consensus for effective and fast economic recovery and roadmap. The statement of the National Security Committee said that the attempt to tackle the challenges of 30 million flood victims was informed that all resources were used to work on the restoration and reconstruction of flood victims with provincial governments and multi -financial institutions. The statement added that the security committee meeting also praised the ongoing relief efforts led by the Prime Minister and the federal units. The committee was informed about the country's security situation and especially the recent terrorist incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the statement said. The Prime Minister emphasized that the federal and provincial governments will patronize the fight against terrorism under the National Action Plan with the National Economic Development and National Internal Security Policy for the people. He said the armed forces would provide a full, safe and favorable environment. The statement said that no country will be allowed to provide a shelter or facility for terrorists and Pakistan protects all the rights of its citizens in this regard. The National Security Committee reaffirmed his commitment to not tolerate terrorism in Pakistan and reiterated his commitment to spread tensions or to deal with all organizations. The meeting regarding terrorism said that it would be dealt with in full force. The meeting said that there could be no compromise on the security of Pakistan and the full process of the state would be established in every corner of Pakistan. The Security Committee statement said that provincial Apex committees have also been restored and law enforcement agencies, especially the Anti -Terrorism Department, will be brought to the standard of fighting with the desired capacity. It should be remembered that at a meeting held on Friday, the National Security Committee had vowed to end terrorism with full force and postponed the meeting till Monday so that the decisions could be finalized keeping in view the proposals. The National Security Committee is the most important forum for foreign policy and national security decision -making, with senior civilian and military leadership participating in the meeting. It is unusual for the National Security Committee to continue for the second round, so it was believed that decisions would be made not only to tackle terrorism but also to strengthen the country's destructive economy. Government sources said that the civil and military leadership has decided that Pakistan, the most victims of terrorism in the world, have achieved peace after a long war on terror that began in 2001. He said that the state would not allow terrorism to be raised again as this peace was achieved by the sacrifice of thousands of Pakistani citizens. During the past few months, the law and order situation in the country has worsened, terrorist groups like the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan, ISIS and Gul Bahadur groups are conducting indiscriminate attacks across the country. In Balochistan, the rebels have also intensified their violent activities and has set up alliance with the banned TTP. The incident at the Investigation Center of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Anti -Terrorism Department in Bannu and the suicide bombing in Islamabad not only raised the alarm in the House but also worried many countries about the security of their citizens."

Chairman PTI said that he (the present government) has pushed the domestic economy here today that today there are only two ways in the new year, a big difficult decision is to go to the IMF, the other is a difficult decision if we do not go to the IMF. He said that if he goes to the IMF, another wave of inflation will come, he has done the economy of the country, it has never happened in the history of our country, we used to read what the economic hit man does, he debts the country and then all the assets of the country are cheap. Imran Khan said that the country is going to prepare, inflation is coming now, we have no choice but to go to the IMF program. If we do not go to the IMF, we will default, it will bring more problems, which will come to us after going to the program. He said that the thieves imposed on us, we have to confront them, we do not run out, we have a new case every other day, we have not left the country, we have not run out, life is in danger. The former Prime Minister said that when the crisis comes, there is an opportunity to reform itself, fix our institutions, bring the rule of law in Pakistan, it is only one way to get out of the destruction that is coming in the way. The nation should stand that we want justice. Imran Khan said that when the floods came to Pakistan, we collected money for the flood victims, I have been collecting money for Shaukat Khanum for 30 years, Namal University and PTI for 17 years. Whatever money I collect, I do all the things transparent, I always have all the money, I have all the money. He said that we had decided that the money that would be collected would give us to all the provinces, Sindh government and NDMA were not giving data, we had decided to distribute one billion rupees in Sindh but the data was not available. The former Prime Minister said that we have one billion rupees, we need data. If we get data, we have decided that we will deliver money to 40,000 people. He said that I would like to tell my people that whenever there was a tragedy in our country, the nation gave heartfelt money which may not give the countries of the world. Later, Sania Nishtar said that people had asked to pay Rs 15 billion in 3 television so far Rs 4 billion 60 crore has come, out of which Rs 3 billion 60 crore has been spent, we have kept one billion rupees for Sindh. He said that we expect the survey in Sindh to be completed, the sooner they will give us the data, the sooner we will distribute one billion rupees to 40,000 people. He said that aid from credit card was unsuccessful on the basis of five different reasons, so no heavy amount of Rs 4 billion 30 crore could be received."

Statistics Bureau data showed a double digit hike in almost all the housing, utility and communication items except for the housing, utility and communication, however, the rapidly damaged foods and transport prices decreased by 12.58 % on a monthly basis and 0.81 % on the last months. Last week, the Finance Ministry predicted the serious situation facing the domestic economy, saying that inflation rate would remain between 21 and 23 percent during the current financial year. The Ministry of Finance said in its 'monthly economic update and outlook' that the economic growth budget is likely to remain less than the set target due to floods in FY 2023.  The report said that \"low growth rate, high inflation rate and reduction in foreign exchange reserves are one of the key challenges for policy makers.\" Pakistan has been in the grip of the highest inflation for decades for the past few months, but in September, the CPI rose to 23.2 percent, the highest level in 49 years in August. The trend of inflation was seen again the next month, when inflation rose rapidly in October to 26.6, after which the central bank key policy rate increased from 100 base points to the highest level of 24 years, while the decision was said to prevent inflation. After that, inflation declined significantly during November and it reached 23.8 %, after which it saw a rise again."

         "Pakistani politicians expressed their best wishes on the arrival of the year, emphasizing national solidarity, some leaders cited the most important political events that took place last year, while some political figures expressed regret over the destructive floods of the country's history. President Arif Alawi said that last year the Pakistani nation faced various challenges, but we came out of difficult conditions thanks to our hard work, bravery, determination, determination and consistency. In a statement issued by the President, he said that after successfully controlling the Corona virus epidemic, Pakistan also suffered a historic flood in the dimensions of the country. The President said that I had the opportunity to visit the flooded areas and to review the losses there, I met with the difficult Pakistani people and listened to their problems. During the flood, where I saw various problems, losses and destruction of floods, I saw my nation's firmness, patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, Arif Alawi added that we need to utilize our capabilities to remove Pakistan from the problems and to take the path of development. Pakistan today has various economic difficulties, political instability, law and order situation, re -raising terrorism, climate change, poverty and poverty. He said that in the New Year we have to properly determine our priorities as a nation to overcome these issues facing the nation. We have to work with national solidarity, unity, discipline, constant hard work, passion and dedication to make the country a prosperous, developed, democratic and stable country. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif pledged to work hard to improve the economic situation, restore flood victims, eliminate terrorism and reduce the suffering of the people at the beginning of the year. In his message, the Prime Minister said that the beginning of the New Year congratulates the entire nation and pray that the sun of 2023 will rise with the good news of development and prosperity for our country Pakistan, in the New Year, our individual and collective lives will improve the mistakes of the past year and a new beginning of a new future. He also prayed that the world faced the economic, political and law and order crisis in 2022, there was a positive progress to overcome them in the New Year, the new year proved to be the end of hunger, war, terrorism, crime, sectarianism and class division from all over the world, including Pakistan. He said that last year, the patriots faced many difficulties. In the wider interest of Pakistan's economy and the people, when we took the constitutional path, the country tried to create a constitutional crisis and chaos. The Prime Minister said that in the meantime, climate change caused the worst flood situation in the country which left hundreds of people dead, injured thousands, more than 300 million people were affected by it and financially developing country like Pakistan suffered $ 30 billion. He said that I monitored the help of flood victims, as a servant of Pakistan and tried to reduce their pain by going to the people in grief, every official of the coalition government, including me, called for flood victims in every corner of the world. On the other hand, former Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan described 2022 as the best and worst. In his statement on Twitter, he said that the year 2022 was simultaneously and the worst, in personal interest, a conspiracy was removed by a conspiracy to show the best economic performance and Pakistan was handed over to a group of criminals. He said that the group kissed the economy, gave itself NRO 2 and opened the door to looting for all white -collar criminals through amendments to NAB law. He said that this year was excellent that in the meantime I saw the people of Pakistan in the mold of a nation, with the full backing of the Election Commission and the power of all the political parties of the country, despite the unity of all the political parties of the country. The former Prime Minister said that nowadays, despite the disappointment of the national scenario, especially due to the disappointment of bankruptcy, I believe in the Lord and my people that the PTI will undoubtedly establish a strong government through elections in 2023 and Pakistan will be promoted by the government and its country. He said that solid structure reforms would be made to get Pakistan out of the crisis. Imported government and its supporters have put the country in a crisis. Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari declared the year 2022 as a historic year due to the abolition of Imran Khan's government as a result of a successful movement, in which the elected parliament won against the selected Hakran by the votes of the people. Bilawal Bhutto, a statement issued on Twitter, said, \"We are united to save Pakistan. They will be a year of victory and hope for unity against 2023 hatred, truth and division against falsehood.\" Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Information and Information Maryam Aurangzeb congratulated the nation on the New Year and said that 2023 should be the Naveed Bihar of happiness, development and prosperity, the youth should find the destination of dreams and broken hearts. In one of his tweets, the Federal Minister said that the new year is a blessing, may God give the wounds of humanity to the wounds of humanity, inflation, terrorism, injustice, injustice, lies and hatred. Federal Minister for Information said that the nave of happiness, development and prosperity should be spring, young people have dreams, get broken hearts, get sick health, end unrest and promote peace. In another tweet, Mary Aurangzeb reacted strongly to Imran Khan's statement, criticizing the former Prime Minister. He said that the person imprisoned in his own self does not think ahead, nor does anyone think of the grief, nor does anyone have a sense of happiness, who does not have to share the happiness and sorrow of the happiness of others."

         "In a decade for security personnel in Pakistan, the year ended 2022 with the deadliest month, with a new wave of terrorist activities containing the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and ISIS-Afghanistan. According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, a report released by the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) states that Pakistan is likely to face more violent incidents in 2023. In 2022, at least 282 security personnel were martyred, of which 40 were martyred during the December attacks alone, including the improvised bombing (IED) attacks, suicide attacks and most of the attacks on security posts in Pak-Afghan border areas. During 2022, Pakistan faced 376 terrorist attacks, banned terrorist organizations like TTP, ISIS and BLA claimed responsibility for 57 attacks, the total number of casualties as a result of terrorist incidents was 973. Overall, violent incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa increased extraordinarily, where the number of casualties increased by 108 %. As a result of these incidents, 62 percent of the martyrdom occurred by civilians, government officials and security personnel, while the remaining 38 percent of the casualties killed militants, rebels and others involved in illegal activities. The report states that such an unusual series of terrorism began in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan shortly after the banned TTP announced the end of the war, which resulted in more than 2 dozen attacks in December alone. As a result, the mortality rate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has increased by about 64 % of the total deaths resulting from terrorism in the country, followed by 26 % of the deaths belonging to Balochistan. Authorities claim that most of the incidents of terrorism are found in eastern Afghanistan, where Afghan Taliban of TTP leading militants are hospitalizing. The Afghan Taliban resurrected the issue of the Durand Line, raising questions on a border fence costing $ 50 million, as well as being destroyed. Most of the terrorist attacks were focused in Bannu, adjacent to Waziristan, Bajaur and Kurram districts, these districts are directly adjacent to Afghan provinces, Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktia, Paktika, which is why these areas are used to enter Pakistani territory for terrorist purposes. In 2023, further incidents of terrorism are being raised in Pakistan. The incidents that have taken place over the past decade apparently suggest that security forces (including the army and the police), including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, will remain under terrorism, while the challenges will remain in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies also shows that the highest militant attacks in Pakistan in the last 5 years took place in 2022, increased by 28 % and 35 %, with 2021, and 35 %, respectively. During the year 2022, Pakistan suffered nearly 376 terrorist attacks, with 533 deaths and 832 injured. It should be noted that this was the first time since 2017 when more than 300 militants faced attacks in Pakistan in one year."

         "In the scorching sun of Karachi, Qari Zainuddin and his daughter are patiently standing outside Amin House, which has been transformed from a hostel to detention center. In the streets of Sultanabad, the two father and daughter are among about a dozen policemen who are protecting the building, where the city has been in different areas. The father, who is a small tall man, is dressed in a shalwar shirt and a white hat, holds a file firmly in his hand. The girl, whose face is hidden in the veil, is carrying a heavy bag, weighing her 18 -year -old delicate waist. Both are drunk in sweat but are quietly waiting for their turn. When the area's station house officer appears, they immediately run to him, then they are asked to wait more. Zainuddin, an Afghan refugee, came to Pakistan in 1996 when he was a commission. Initially, the Hazara division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was based in Karachi, then moved to Karachi, where he was married. Bibi Raza, who is with him, was born in Karachi and was recently married here but on the third day of Eid, her husband was arrested from a non -shop in Banaras, Orangi Town. Zainuddin said his son -in -law POR (Proof of Residency) had lost cards, so he was arrested. On that day, Zainuddin visited the police station in the area several times, and he was told that Kamaluddin had been sent to Amin House. He points to the file, saying that 'I have come here with all the documents, it contains Razia BB's POR card, marriage contract, birth certificate and vaccination cards'. \"I have a request, either release my son -in -law or take my daughter so that the two can go with Afghanistan, what will she do here alone?\" Zainuddin cries. \"I will wait all day, but unless I get a final answer, I will not leave here.\" And thus Zainuddin stands outside Amin House until a policeman gives them a place to sit. Qari Zainuddin and his daughter are waiting outside Amin House. In recent days, hundreds of Afghans have returned to Afghanistan from the Torkham and Chaman border as the government launched its second deportation program on March 31, targeting Afghan citizen cards, which is an identity document that was jointly released by the Pakistani and Afghan government in 2017. The campaign is part of a major project that the government started in 2023 to send all illegal foreigners back. In the first phase, all non -documentary Afghans were deported, who were not identified. In Karachi, in the past five days, at least 307 Afghan refugees, especially those who have an Afghan Citizen Card (ACC), have been repatriated, according to a temporary police statement that Dawn.com is available. In addition, 11,272 Afghans have been repatriated from April 1 via the Khum border. In 2017, Pakistan, along with the Afghan government, introduced Afghan citizen cards, which were issued to those who could not get POR cards for some reason. The number of ACC holders is about 8 million 40 thousand. The Afghans who crossed the border not only left their homes and property but also left their family members behind. On the other hand, those who are on this side are in a state of constant fear and anxiety. An hour away from Amin House, fear is clearly felt in the streets of the Afghan settlement. Which is a 40 -year -old settlement in the outskirts of Karachi. The road leading to the camp is almost deserted, except for the trucks filled. But inside, the first symbol of life is seen in the narrow and uneven streets, the young boys are gathered around the fossil ball table, the children are running barefoot, a newly built mosque, freshly bursting clutch and scent of squeeze kebab. There are clutches outside the hotel in the Afghan settlement of Karachi. \"Here we are safe,\" says the Afghan township resident and tailor Ibadullah. \"Most of us have not stepped out here for the past week for fear of arrest.\" A few days ago, a crackdown on the town shook them and their neighbors. \"Law enforcement personnel entered our homes and arrested people without checking the ID card,\" he explains. A similar incident took place on Thursday in Alif Square and Sohrab Goth, near the same area, which is 23 minutes away from the town, where most Afghan men come for work. Police conducted raids and continued their arrests. 'They say we are living here illegally, we are born here and play, then how can we be illegal? These POR cards were given to us by the government. ' Ibad Allah says and shows his card and shows it. \"If we were illegal, why did they give us these cards?\" POR cards were introduced in collaboration with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and between 2006 and 2007, 21 million 50 thousand Afghan refugees were issued. These cards were valid for two years, after which they renew every two years. Under this program, refugees had benefits such as opening a bank account, getting jobs and getting education. According to Advocate Maniza Kakar, the deadline for deportation for the POR card holders by the government is June 30. Maniza Kakar is a lawyer and founding member of the Joint Action Committee for Refugee. He claims that arrests are a trick to make money. \"If you give them money, they will leave you, if not, they will grab you and send you the detention center,\" said a angry -filled worship. 'What else do we have? This is a conflict between hiding and exile. ”For some, it is a war between life and death. Gul Alam, a neighbor of Ibadullah, who stands silent. It has been difficult to walk or stand longer in recent times. Being a kidney patient, he has to go to Dr. Ruth Fau Civil Hospital every week but has not left his home for two weeks. Ibadullah and other Afghan settlements are gathered. \"I have nine children, most of whom are daughters. What will she do if I was deported?\" Nearly a young girl looks at the curtain and brings a bullet with water for her father. \"He doesn't even know what Afghanistan is or where,\" Gul Alam, 55, says his daughter. Most of the Afghan settlements have POR cards, which means they are not yet being deported. But it does not diminish their fear or anxiety. Gul Alam said, \"When they come, they do not ask for cards, they just come with sticks and oppression, they have forced so many families to leave the town and hide.\" Afghan refugees who refer to raids and crackdowns examples of the 2023 campaign when the campaign for the first time began. But Saeed Hussain, who is an anthropologist, who is a Pashtun migration in Karachi, makes it clear that these steps have now intensified. \"They are raiding houses and plazas after 12 o'clock in the night, and are only raising people on suspicion that they look Afghan and once they are arrested, they are not sent to the magistrate as they should be given a legal process, but they are sent to Amin House, where they are sent to Amin House.\" It was formally established as an Afghan detention center, but Saeed calls it \"black holes\" because neither lawyers nor anyone else is allowed to enter. \"We do not know how many Afghans are there, what their condition is, or how they are being treated,\" he added, \"We do not even know that those who are being arrested and brought to the hostel have ACC permits or POR cards.\" Afghan refugees whose families were sent to the hostel were similar. An elderly resident of the Afghan settlement, who said on condition of anonymity, said, \"My nephew is in the detention center and is sending us videos, there are about 50 to 70 people being stuck in a room, it is extremely heat, and they are being given food only once a day. Hundreds of people are forced to use the same bathroom. ”Dawn.com also visited Amin House but was not allowed to enter. The hostel is located near the Haji camp near the Rangers headquarters. There are no clear marks of the detention center, which were present in accordance with Saeed but have recently been removed. Only at night's activities suggest that something is happening inside. According to DIG South Asad Raza, the hostel is a shelter where accommodation and food are provided. NADRA and FIA teams are at the center for verification. \"If an Afghan, who has a POR card, is brought here, will be handed over to the relevant police station after confirming NADRA's database,\" he said. Rather, they have been given the task of arresting and deporting those who are not going to voluntarily. 'He made it clear that in the event of an arrest,' if any illegal Afghan arrest can be presented in court under an illegal foreign act and then the Chaman border can be sent to the border to be deported. He was also detained, resulting in a dispute. \"But the purpose of our work is to send them back with respect and respect.\" Meanwhile, refugees are being verified and biometric scanning at Amin House, which is done by NADRA and FIA teams. These scans are used to produce a list or a \"manfest document\", as it says. It includes refugees' names, ID cards, pictures, age, gender and the border through which they have to be sent to Afghanistan. Once the document is ready, refugees are filled in buses and taken to the Chaman border by Jacobabad. On Sunday morning, a convoy of six buses in which a security charge contains a security charge, departed from Amin House and left the Malir Expressway to Karachi-Hyderabad motorway. Outside a shop in an Afghan settlement, the elderly and children in the protection of 8 police mobiles, these buses stop at the same type of detention center in Jacobabad, then head to Chaman, which is 6 hours away. At the border, the \"minor document\" is shared with UNHCR and Afghan government officials. These moments for refugees are their last in Pakistan, before they enter a country from which they or their parents fled here. According to Saeed, who is also a member of the Joint Action Committee for Refugee, once crossing the border, it is very difficult to contact his family. \"Because now these people are viewed with suspicion from both border officials.\" He added that the Taliban government has also said that they cannot take all refugees. 'So what will happen to these people? You have expelled them from a country and sent them to a place that they do not want. ”Boys in the Afghan town are playing fossa ball, UNHCR spokesman Qasim Khan also expressed similar concern while talking to Dawn.com. \"It is important that the return of Afghan refugees be volunteer and dignified so that their resettlement in Afghanistan can be sustained,\" he said. He requested that Pakistan see his condition from a human point of view, he also emphasized the need for dialogue between Islamabad and Kabul. He adds that the agency is talking to the government about the arrest of Afghan refugees, and lawyers are working to release those who are seeking refuge and keeping POR cards. Hundreds of miles away from the Chaman border, the Afghan settlement residents hide their fear, anxiety, anger and hatred under a hope. One of them is Zia -ul -Haq, who is a general store operating in the area, with the flag hoisting Pakistan's flag on the roof. The walls of their shop are written in Urdu in Urdu. \"My father came to Karachi in the 1980s and he named my name in the name of the then military dictator,\" he said, \"he said proudly. \"I named my son Ijaz -ul -Haq to continue this tradition.\" He says that his father started a business here in the Afghan settlement and died for a long time. \"I was born here and grown ... My children were born here and grew up ... My parents and grandparents are buried here ... My country is Pakistan and just Pakistan.\" They shout \"John Janpakistan, Dil Dilpakistan,\" \"We hope and pray that the government should see our love for this country and let us know here.\" Then they ask a worker standing nearby: 'All will be fine?' Zia -ul -Haq has not been able to go to the market and buy his shop again. Reason? Fear again. \"If they arrest me or ask for a bribe?\" Similarly, many other shopkeepers in the area are making the last priority to leave the Afghan settlement, though their luggage is decreasing. But where men are scared, 65 -year -old Ziba is ready to tolerate it. She was only 25 years old when she came to Karachi with her husband and milk. He said, 'I have spent 40 years here, how can I leave? And where will I go? ”There is a swing in front of them in which their grandson is blinking, a rocky blanket is placed on it. \"I don't remember the name of my village or the people living there ... Who is waiting for me?\" Ziba laughed and says, \"My tongue has now changed.\" Ziba, 65, is in the house of a room in an Afghan settlement soon his son, Muhammad Rasool, arrives, who is a driver. \"I had recently gone to Afghanistan,\" he tells Dawn.com. ; Do you know that there are left -handed vehicles? How will I work there? If my work is finished here, I will find someone else, but no one knows me there. ”He says, taking out his POR card. 'This is my identity card, no matter what anyone says. Ziba is also irritated. She says, 'I will not go unless they put me on the bus. One of them is wearing a green and white hat on which a star is connected. All the pictures were made by the writer.

         "The system of life has been suspended in Balochistan for the past several weeks, with most of the highways connecting the province to other parts of the country, while mobile phone services have been suspended. Quetta, which is the provincial capital, is almost locked up and the administration is trying to prevent protesters from entering the city, led by Akhtar Mengal. In such a situation, the sovereignty of the state seems to be completely abolished. Even leaders like Akhtar Mengal and other Baloch nationalists who were once considered to be the last connection between the people and the state, now it seems that their trust in the political process is losing. The former provincial chief minister, who is the head of the Balochistan National Party (BNP) faction, has resigned from the parliament a few months ago and has attributed the apathy of the parliament to the 'insecurity' facing the people of Balochistan. He recently returned from the UAE, where he was living after his resignation from Parliament, and after the recent wave of terrorism and extremism in Balochistan, he is leading the 'Long March' against the arrest of the Baloch Solidarity Committee (BYC) leaders. The march is now joined with several other nationalist parties and central political parties. The growing public anger against state abuses has persuaded Baloch youth to support extremist groups. This disturbing trend can make nationalist parties completely irrelevant. In such a situation, the state will not have anything to do. But there is no understanding of the seriousness of the situation in the routes of power in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Instead, we are witnessing the increasing use of force to silence the sounds, and they are being forced to abandon the democratic path. In the context of growing violence and terrorism by militants, the crackdown against political opposition has made the province's situation very unpredictable. A broken provincial government, whose legal status is also questioned, has completely failed. It is evident that the real power is with the establishment, which only sees the situation with the 'security lens'. This has been a major reason for the people of the state to lose their hearts and minds. It certainly provides terrorist groups to work with more immunity. The recent wave of high -profile terrorist attacks across the province is also evidence of losing control of the state. According to some reports, 20 districts of the province are now influenced by the violence and political violence of the militants. The abolition of the administration has worsened the situation. According to reports, some ministers of the provincial cabinet cannot go to their constituencies despite heavy security. The recent hijacking of a passenger train and simultaneous terrorist attacks in different parts of the province clarify the growing capabilities of militant groups. This would not have been possible without local cooperation. The crackdown by security forces provides more recruits to these groups. The growing involvement of female fighters has made Baloch militancy more deadly. There have been many incidents of terrorist attacks by women suicide bombers, especially on security targets. Women are also leading the rights movement. For example, many people see Dr. Mahi Rang Baloch as the Right Movement as a torch path. Most women who are now leading the rights movement have their own stories that their families are suffering from state repression. The emergence of a new generation of young and educated Baloch resistance leadership has made the old guard politically irrelevant. The state now has to deal with them. But it seems that the province has no understanding of the rapidly changing political scenario. What is happening in Balochistan is the result of decades of state mismanagement, ignoring and depriving people of their basic political and economic rights. Increasing alienation and increasing separation, militant violence seems to be a reaction to the colonial methods and mentality of our ruling elite and the establishment. Security forces face the fifth Baloch uprising. Earlier in 1948, 59-1958, 63-1962, and 77-1973 there were four uprising. But this time the rebels appear to be more ready and they have the latest weapons and modern communication systems. After the last uprising, the province remained relatively stable and as a result of the restoration of democracy in 1988, the Baloch nationalists came into the mainstream. Although many of his demands regarding natural gas royalty and the province's natural resources were not met, democratic rule gave the Baloch a sense of political participation. The tensions began to rise in 2003 when the Musharraf government announced the plan for three new camps in the province. This idea did not go well with local political forces. The increasing deployment of security personnel further dissatisfied. In Balochistan, even the maintenance of law and order is mostly with the federally -controlled paramilitary forces. It has worsened the situation in addition to other matters. Even the present provincial government, which has been supported by the establishment, has no real power. There was also an idea that increasing terrorism and protests would be taken as a 'wake -up call' and would force the federal government and the establishment to sit with nationalist leaders and seek political solutions, but that did not happen. Instead, the government has set up a \"tough state\" committee headed by the Federal Home Minister. Now it is difficult to understand what it means. There are many questions about what the 'hard state' real means. The state can only be strengthened when the causes of people's dissatisfaction are eliminated, not to show. We can only hope to make better decisions, it is too late before it is. Read this post in English."

         "The National Security Committee meeting reaffirmed its commitment to not tolerate terrorism in Pakistan, and reiterated the commitment to spread tensions with all organizations with full force. In a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office after the National Security Committee, the 40th meeting of the National Security Committee was chaired by Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, attended by the concerned federal ministers, the chiefs of the Armed Forces and the heads of intelligence agencies. The statement said that the concept of 'national security' embraces economic security and that it is suppressed at national sovereignty and dignity without economic self -sufficiency or sovereignty. The meeting was informed that the meeting reviewed the country's economic situation and the challenges in a comprehensive manner that was especially faced by the people belonging to Pakistan's low income and middle class. The Federal Finance Minister gave the meeting a briefing on the Roadmap of Economic Stability, including the status of negotiations with global financial institutions, as well as a briefing on finding other financial sources based on mutual interest and providing relief to the public. A statement from the Prime Minister's Office said that the National Security Committee has agreed to concrete steps to strengthen the economy, which includes the importation of imports and illegal withdrawal of currency and preventing handicrafts. According to the statement, the meeting agreed that focus would be on improving agricultural and industrial production, especially to ensure food protection. In addition, alternative imports and employment opportunities will also be ensured. It was further agreed that it would be a priority to make public -friendly policies that would benefit the common man. It was further stated that it was also agreed to include all stakeholders to create a consensus for effective and fast economic recovery and roadmap. The statement of the National Security Committee said that the attempt to tackle the challenges of 30 million flood victims was informed that all resources were used to work on the restoration and reconstruction of flood victims with provincial governments and multi -financial institutions. The statement added that the security committee meeting also praised the ongoing relief efforts led by the Prime Minister and the federal units. The committee was informed about the country's security situation and especially the recent terrorist incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the statement said. The Prime Minister emphasized that the federal and provincial governments will patronize the fight against terrorism under the National Action Plan with the National Economic Development and National Internal Security Policy for the people. He said the armed forces would provide a full, safe and favorable environment. The statement said that no country will be allowed to provide a shelter or facility for terrorists and Pakistan protects all the rights of its citizens in this regard. The National Security Committee reaffirmed his commitment to not tolerate terrorism in Pakistan and reiterated his commitment to spread tensions or to deal with all organizations. The meeting regarding terrorism said that it would be dealt with in full force. The meeting said that there could be no compromise on the security of Pakistan and the full process of the state would be established in every corner of Pakistan. The Security Committee statement said that provincial Apex committees have also been restored and law enforcement agencies, especially the Anti -Terrorism Department, will be brought to the standard of fighting with the desired capacity. It should be remembered that at a meeting held on Friday, the National Security Committee had vowed to end terrorism with full force and postponed the meeting till Monday so that the decisions could be finalized keeping in view the proposals. The National Security Committee is the most important forum for foreign policy and national security decision -making, with senior civilian and military leadership participating in the meeting. It is unusual for the National Security Committee to continue for the second round, so it was believed that decisions would be made not only to tackle terrorism but also to strengthen the country's destructive economy. Government sources said that the civil and military leadership has decided that Pakistan, the most victims of terrorism in the world, have achieved peace after a long war on terror that began in 2001. He said that the state would not allow terrorism to be raised again as this peace was achieved by the sacrifice of thousands of Pakistani citizens. During the past few months, the law and order situation in the country has worsened, terrorist groups like the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan, ISIS and Gul Bahadur groups are conducting indiscriminate attacks across the country. In Balochistan, the rebels have also intensified their violent activities and has set up alliance with the banned TTP. The incident at the Investigation Center of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Anti -Terrorism Department in Bannu and the suicide bombing in Islamabad not only raised the alarm in the House but also worried many countries about the security of their citizens."

         "Former Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan has said that if we do not go to the World Financial Organization (IMF), we will be defaulted. Addressing the video, Imran Khan said that a good time comes in the lives of the nations, a part of the high life, the big decision was made in April, despite the corona, our government's performance was excellent in Pakistan's history. Chairman PTI said that he (the present government) has pushed the domestic economy here today that today there are only two ways in the new year, a big difficult decision is to go to the IMF, the other is a difficult decision if we do not go to the IMF. He said that if he goes to the IMF, another wave of inflation will come, he has done the economy of the country, it has never happened in the history of our country, we used to read what the economic hit man does, he debts the country and then all the assets of the country are cheap. Imran Khan said that the country is going to prepare, inflation is coming now, we have no choice but to go to the IMF program. If we do not go to the IMF, we will default, it will bring more problems, which will come to us after going to the program. He said that the thieves imposed on us, we have to confront them, we do not run out, we have a new case every other day, we have not left the country, we have not run out, life is in danger. The former Prime Minister said that when the crisis comes, there is an opportunity to reform itself, fix our institutions, bring the rule of law in Pakistan, it is only one way to get out of the destruction that is coming in the way. The nation should stand that we want justice. Imran Khan said that when the floods came to Pakistan, we collected money for the flood victims, I have been collecting money for Shaukat Khanum for 30 years, Namal University and PTI for 17 years. Whatever money I collect, I do all the things transparent, I always have all the money, I have all the money. He said that we had decided that the money that would be collected would give us to all the provinces, Sindh government and NDMA were not giving data, we had decided to distribute one billion rupees in Sindh but the data was not available. The former Prime Minister said that we have one billion rupees, we need data. If we get data, we have decided that we will deliver money to 40,000 people. He said that I would like to tell my people that whenever there was a tragedy in our country, the nation gave heartfelt money which may not give the countries of the world. Later, Sania Nishtar said that people had asked to pay Rs 15 billion in 3 television so far Rs 4 billion 60 crore has come, out of which Rs 3 billion 60 crore has been spent, we have kept one billion rupees for Sindh. He said that we expect the survey in Sindh to be completed, the sooner they will give us the data, the sooner we will distribute one billion rupees to 40,000 people. He said that aid from credit card was unsuccessful on the basis of five different reasons, so no heavy amount of Rs 4 billion 30 crore could be received."

According to data released by the Pakistan Statistics Bureau (PBS), the annual inflation by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was recorded at 24.5 percent in December, up 23.8 percent last month, while the ongoing trend of inflation is due to heavy food and transport costs. Inflation increased by 0.5 % on a monthly basis, compared to a 0.76 % increase in November. Topline Securities said the inflation was in accordance with the expectations of the market. Statistics Bureau data showed a double digit hike in almost all the housing, utility and communication items except for the housing, utility and communication, however, the rapidly damaged foods and transport prices decreased by 12.58 % on a monthly basis and 0.81 % on the last months. Last week, the Finance Ministry predicted the serious situation facing the domestic economy, saying that inflation rate would remain between 21 and 23 percent during the current financial year. The Ministry of Finance said in its 'monthly economic update and outlook' that the economic growth budget is likely to remain less than the set target due to floods in FY 2023.  The report said that \"low growth rate, high inflation rate and reduction in foreign exchange reserves are one of the key challenges for policy makers.\" Pakistan has been in the grip of the highest inflation for decades for the past few months, but in September, the CPI rose to 23.2 percent, the highest level in 49 years in August. The trend of inflation was seen again the next month, when inflation rose rapidly in October to 26.6, after which the central bank key policy rate increased from 100 base points to the highest level of 24 years, while the decision was said to prevent inflation. After that, inflation declined significantly during November and it reached 23.8 %, after which it saw a rise again."

         "Pakistani politicians expressed their best wishes on the arrival of the year, emphasizing national solidarity, some leaders cited the most important political events that took place last year, while some political figures expressed regret over the destructive floods of the country's history. President Arif Alawi said that last year the Pakistani nation faced various challenges, but we came out of difficult conditions thanks to our hard work, bravery, determination, determination and consistency. In a statement issued by the President, he said that after successfully controlling the Corona virus epidemic, Pakistan also suffered a historic flood in the dimensions of the country. The President said that I had the opportunity to visit the flooded areas and to review the losses there, I met with the difficult Pakistani people and listened to their problems. During the flood, where I saw various problems, losses and destruction of floods, I saw my nation's firmness, patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, patriotism, Arif Alawi added that we need to utilize our capabilities to remove Pakistan from the problems and to take the path of development. Pakistan today has various economic difficulties, political instability, law and order situation, re -raising terrorism, climate change, poverty and poverty. He said that in the New Year we have to properly determine our priorities as a nation to overcome these issues facing the nation. We have to work with national solidarity, unity, discipline, constant hard work, passion and dedication to make the country a prosperous, developed, democratic and stable country. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif pledged to work hard to improve the economic situation, restore flood victims, eliminate terrorism and reduce the suffering of the people at the beginning of the year. In his message, the Prime Minister said that the beginning of the New Year congratulates the entire nation and pray that the sun of 2023 will rise with the good news of development and prosperity for our country Pakistan, in the New Year, our individual and collective lives will improve the mistakes of the past year and a new beginning of a new future. He also prayed that the world faced the economic, political and law and order crisis in 2022, there was a positive progress to overcome them in the New Year, the new year proved to be the end of hunger, war, terrorism, crime, sectarianism and class division from all over the world, including Pakistan. He said that last year, the patriots faced many difficulties. In the wider interest of Pakistan's economy and the people, when we took the constitutional path, the country tried to create a constitutional crisis and chaos. The Prime Minister said that in the meantime, climate change caused the worst flood situation in the country which left hundreds of people dead, injured thousands, more than 300 million people were affected by it and financially developing country like Pakistan suffered $ 30 billion. He said that I monitored the help of flood victims, as a servant of Pakistan and tried to reduce their pain by going to the people in grief, every official of the coalition government, including me, called for flood victims in every corner of the world. On the other hand, former Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan described 2022 as the best and worst. In his statement on Twitter, he said that the year 2022 was simultaneously and the worst, in personal interest, a conspiracy was removed by a conspiracy to show the best economic performance and Pakistan was handed over to a group of criminals. He said that the group kissed the economy, gave itself NRO 2 and opened the door to looting for all white -collar criminals through amendments to NAB law. He said that this year was excellent that in the meantime I saw the people of Pakistan in the mold of a nation, with the full backing of the Election Commission and the power of all the political parties of the country, despite the unity of all the political parties of the country. The former Prime Minister said that nowadays, despite the disappointment of the national scenario, especially due to the disappointment of bankruptcy, I believe in the Lord and my people that the PTI will undoubtedly establish a strong government through elections in 2023 and Pakistan will be promoted by the government and its country. He said that solid structure reforms would be made to get Pakistan out of the crisis. Imported government and its supporters have put the country in a crisis. Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari declared the year 2022 as a historic year due to the abolition of Imran Khan's government as a result of a successful movement, in which the elected parliament won against the selected Hakran by the votes of the people. Bilawal Bhutto, a statement issued on Twitter, said, \"We are united to save Pakistan. They will be a year of victory and hope for unity against 2023 hatred, truth and division against falsehood.\" Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Information and Information Maryam Aurangzeb congratulated the nation on the New Year and said that 2023 should be the Naveed Bihar of happiness, development and prosperity, the youth should find the destination of dreams and broken hearts. In one of his tweets, the Federal Minister said that the new year is a blessing, may God give the wounds of humanity to the wounds of humanity, inflation, terrorism, injustice, injustice, lies and hatred. Federal Minister for Information said that the nave of happiness, development and prosperity should be spring, young people have dreams, get broken hearts, get sick health, end unrest and promote peace. In another tweet, Mary Aurangzeb reacted strongly to Imran Khan's statement, criticizing the former Prime Minister. He said that the person imprisoned in his own self does not think ahead, nor does anyone think of the grief, nor does anyone have a sense of happiness, who does not have to share the happiness and sorrow of the happiness of others."

         "In a decade for security personnel in Pakistan, the year ended 2022 with the deadliest month, with a new wave of terrorist activities containing the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and ISIS-Afghanistan. According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, a report released by the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) states that Pakistan is likely to face more violent incidents in 2023. In 2022, at least 282 security personnel were martyred, of which 40 were martyred during the December attacks alone, including the improvised bombing (IED) attacks, suicide attacks and most of the attacks on security posts in Pak-Afghan border areas. During 2022, Pakistan faced 376 terrorist attacks, banned terrorist organizations like TTP, ISIS and BLA claimed responsibility for 57 attacks, the total number of casualties as a result of terrorist incidents was 973. Overall, violent incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa increased extraordinarily, where the number of casualties increased by 108 %. As a result of these incidents, 62 percent of the martyrdom occurred by civilians, government officials and security personnel, while the remaining 38 percent of the casualties killed militants, rebels and others involved in illegal activities. The report states that such an unusual series of terrorism began in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan shortly after the banned TTP announced the end of the war, which resulted in more than 2 dozen attacks in December alone. As a result, the mortality rate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has increased by about 64 % of the total deaths resulting from terrorism in the country, followed by 26 % of the deaths belonging to Balochistan. Authorities claim that most of the incidents of terrorism are found in eastern Afghanistan, where Afghan Taliban of TTP leading militants are hospitalizing. The Afghan Taliban resurrected the issue of the Durand Line, raising questions on a border fence costing $ 50 million, as well as being destroyed. Most of the terrorist attacks were focused in Bannu, adjacent to Waziristan, Bajaur and Kurram districts, these districts are directly adjacent to Afghan provinces, Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktia, Paktika, which is why these areas are used to enter Pakistani territory for terrorist purposes. In 2023, further incidents of terrorism are being raised in Pakistan. The incidents that have taken place over the past decade apparently suggest that security forces (including the army and the police), including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, will remain under terrorism, while the challenges will remain in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies also shows that the highest militant attacks in Pakistan in the last 5 years took place in 2022, increased by 28 % and 35 %, with 2021, and 35 %, respectively. During the year 2022, Pakistan suffered nearly 376 terrorist attacks, with 533 deaths and 832 injured. It should be noted that this was the first time since 2017 when more than 300 militants faced attacks in Pakistan in one year."

         "In the scorching sun of Karachi, Qari Zainuddin and his daughter are patiently standing outside Amin House, which has been transformed from a hostel to detention center. In the streets of Sultanabad, the two father and daughter are among about a dozen policemen who are protecting the building, where the city has been in different areas. The father, who is a small tall man, is dressed in a shalwar shirt and a white hat, holds a file firmly in his hand. The girl, whose face is hidden in the veil, is carrying a heavy bag, weighing her 18 -year -old delicate waist. Both are drunk in sweat but are quietly waiting for their turn. When the area's station house officer appears, they immediately run to him, then they are asked to wait more. Zainuddin, an Afghan refugee, came to Pakistan in 1996 when he was a commission. Initially, the Hazara division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was based in Karachi, then moved to Karachi, where he was married. Bibi Raza, who is with him, was born in Karachi and was recently married here but on the third day of Eid, her husband was arrested from a non -shop in Banaras, Orangi Town. Zainuddin said his son -in -law POR (Proof of Residency) had lost cards, so he was arrested. On that day, Zainuddin visited the police station in the area several times, and he was told that Kamaluddin had been sent to Amin House. He points to the file, saying that 'I have come here with all the documents, it contains Razia BB's POR card, marriage contract, birth certificate and vaccination cards'. \"I have a request, either release my son -in -law or take my daughter so that the two can go with Afghanistan, what will she do here alone?\" Zainuddin cries. \"I will wait all day, but unless I get a final answer, I will not leave here.\" And thus Zainuddin stands outside Amin House until a policeman gives them a place to sit. Qari Zainuddin and his daughter are waiting outside Amin House. In recent days, hundreds of Afghans have returned to Afghanistan from the Torkham and Chaman border as the government launched its second deportation program on March 31, targeting Afghan citizen cards, which is an identity document that was jointly released by the Pakistani and Afghan government in 2017. The campaign is part of a major project that the government started in 2023 to send all illegal foreigners back. In the first phase, all non -documentary Afghans were deported, who were not identified. In Karachi, in the past five days, at least 307 Afghan refugees, especially those who have an Afghan Citizen Card (ACC), have been repatriated, according to a temporary police statement that Dawn.com is available. In addition, 11,272 Afghans have been repatriated from April 1 via the Khum border. In 2017, Pakistan, along with the Afghan government, introduced Afghan citizen cards, which were issued to those who could not get POR cards for some reason. The number of ACC holders is about 8 million 40 thousand. The Afghans who crossed the border not only left their homes and property but also left their family members behind. On the other hand, those who are on this side are in a state of constant fear and anxiety. An hour away from Amin House, fear is clearly felt in the streets of the Afghan settlement. Which is a 40 -year -old settlement in the outskirts of Karachi. The road leading to the camp is almost deserted, except for the trucks filled. But inside, the first symbol of life is seen in the narrow and uneven streets, the young boys are gathered around the fossil ball table, the children are running barefoot, a newly built mosque, freshly bursting clutch and scent of squeeze kebab. There are clutches outside the hotel in the Afghan settlement of Karachi. \"Here we are safe,\" says the Afghan township resident and tailor Ibadullah. \"Most of us have not stepped out here for the past week for fear of arrest.\" A few days ago, a crackdown on the town shook them and their neighbors. \"Law enforcement personnel entered our homes and arrested people without checking the ID card,\" he explains. A similar incident took place on Thursday in Alif Square and Sohrab Goth, near the same area, which is 23 minutes away from the town, where most Afghan men come for work. Police conducted raids and continued their arrests. 'They say we are living here illegally, we are born here and play, then how can we be illegal? These POR cards were given to us by the government. ' Ibad Allah says and shows his card and shows it. \"If we were illegal, why did they give us these cards?\" POR cards were introduced in collaboration with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and between 2006 and 2007, 21 million 50 thousand Afghan refugees were issued. These cards were valid for two years, after which they renew every two years. Under this program, refugees had benefits such as opening a bank account, getting jobs and getting education. According to Advocate Maniza Kakar, the deadline for deportation for the POR card holders by the government is June 30. Maniza Kakar is a lawyer and founding member of the Joint Action Committee for Refugee. He claims that arrests are a trick to make money. \"If you give them money, they will leave you, if not, they will grab you and send you the detention center,\" said a angry -filled worship. 'What else do we have? This is a conflict between hiding and exile. ”For some, it is a war between life and death. Gul Alam, a neighbor of Ibadullah, who stands silent. It has been difficult to walk or stand longer in recent times. Being a kidney patient, he has to go to Dr. Ruth Fau Civil Hospital every week but has not left his home for two weeks. Ibadullah and other Afghan settlements are gathered. \"I have nine children, most of whom are daughters. What will she do if I was deported?\" Nearly a young girl looks at the curtain and brings a bullet with water for her father. \"He doesn't even know what Afghanistan is or where,\" Gul Alam, 55, says his daughter. Most of the Afghan settlements have POR cards, which means they are not yet being deported. But it does not diminish their fear or anxiety. Gul Alam said, \"When they come, they do not ask for cards, they just come with sticks and oppression, they have forced so many families to leave the town and hide.\" Afghan refugees who refer to raids and crackdowns examples of the 2023 campaign when the campaign for the first time began. But Saeed Hussain, who is an anthropologist, who is a Pashtun migration in Karachi, makes it clear that these steps have now intensified. \"They are raiding houses and plazas after 12 o'clock in the night, and are only raising people on suspicion that they look Afghan and once they are arrested, they are not sent to the magistrate as they should be given a legal process, but they are sent to Amin House, where they are sent to Amin House.\" It was formally established as an Afghan detention center, but Saeed calls it \"black holes\" because neither lawyers nor anyone else is allowed to enter. \"We do not know how many Afghans are there, what their condition is, or how they are being treated,\" he added, \"We do not even know that those who are being arrested and brought to the hostel have ACC permits or POR cards.\" Afghan refugees whose families were sent to the hostel were similar. An elderly resident of the Afghan settlement, who said on condition of anonymity, said, \"My nephew is in the detention center and is sending us videos, there are about 50 to 70 people being stuck in a room, it is extremely heat, and they are being given food only once a day. Hundreds of people are forced to use the same bathroom. ”Dawn.com also visited Amin House but was not allowed to enter. The hostel is located near the Haji camp near the Rangers headquarters. There are no clear marks of the detention center, which were present in accordance with Saeed but have recently been removed. Only at night's activities suggest that something is happening inside. According to DIG South Asad Raza, the hostel is a shelter where accommodation and food are provided. NADRA and FIA teams are at the center for verification. \"If an Afghan, who has a POR card, is brought here, will be handed over to the relevant police station after confirming NADRA's database,\" he said. Rather, they have been given the task of arresting and deporting those who are not going to voluntarily. 'He made it clear that in the event of an arrest,' if any illegal Afghan arrest can be presented in court under an illegal foreign act and then the Chaman border can be sent to the border to be deported. He was also detained, resulting in a dispute. \"But the purpose of our work is to send them back with respect and respect.\" Meanwhile, refugees are being verified and biometric scanning at Amin House, which is done by NADRA and FIA teams. These scans are used to produce a list or a \"manfest document\", as it says. It includes refugees' names, ID cards, pictures, age, gender and the border through which they have to be sent to Afghanistan. Once the document is ready, refugees are filled in buses and taken to the Chaman border by Jacobabad. On Sunday morning, a convoy of six buses in which a security charge contains a security charge, departed from Amin House and left the Malir Expressway to Karachi-Hyderabad motorway. Outside a shop in an Afghan settlement, the elderly and children in the protection of 8 police mobiles, these buses stop at the same type of detention center in Jacobabad, then head to Chaman, which is 6 hours away. At the border, the \"minor document\" is shared with UNHCR and Afghan government officials. These moments for refugees are their last in Pakistan, before they enter a country from which they or their parents fled here. According to Saeed, who is also a member of the Joint Action Committee for Refugee, once crossing the border, it is very difficult to contact his family. \"Because now these people are viewed with suspicion from both border officials.\" He added that the Taliban government has also said that they cannot take all refugees. 'So what will happen to these people? You have expelled them from a country and sent them to a place that they do not want. ”Boys in the Afghan town are playing fossa ball, UNHCR spokesman Qasim Khan also expressed similar concern while talking to Dawn.com. \"It is important that the return of Afghan refugees be volunteer and dignified so that their resettlement in Afghanistan can be sustained,\" he said. He requested that Pakistan see his condition from a human point of view, he also emphasized the need for dialogue between Islamabad and Kabul. He adds that the agency is talking to the government about the arrest of Afghan refugees, and lawyers are working to release those who are seeking refuge and keeping POR cards. Hundreds of miles away from the Chaman border, the Afghan settlement residents hide their fear, anxiety, anger and hatred under a hope. One of them is Zia -ul -Haq, who is a general store operating in the area, with the flag hoisting Pakistan's flag on the roof. The walls of their shop are written in Urdu in Urdu. \"My father came to Karachi in the 1980s and he named my name in the name of the then military dictator,\" he said, \"he said proudly. \"I named my son Ijaz -ul -Haq to continue this tradition.\" He says that his father started a business here in the Afghan settlement and died for a long time. \"I was born here and grown ... My children were born here and grew up ... My parents and grandparents are buried here ... My country is Pakistan and just Pakistan.\" They shout \"John Janpakistan, Dil Dilpakistan,\" \"We hope and pray that the government should see our love for this country and let us know here.\" Then they ask a worker standing nearby: 'All will be fine?' Zia -ul -Haq has not been able to go to the market and buy his shop again. Reason? Fear again. \"If they arrest me or ask for a bribe?\" Similarly, many other shopkeepers in the area are making the last priority to leave the Afghan settlement, though their luggage is decreasing. But where men are scared, 65 -year -old Ziba is ready to tolerate it. She was only 25 years old when she came to Karachi with her husband and milk. He said, 'I have spent 40 years here, how can I leave? And where will I go? ”There is a swing in front of them in which their grandson is blinking, a rocky blanket is placed on it. \"I don't remember the name of my village or the people living there ... Who is waiting for me?\" Ziba laughed and says, \"My tongue has now changed.\" Ziba, 65, is in the house of a room in an Afghan settlement soon his son, Muhammad Rasool, arrives, who is a driver. \"I had recently gone to Afghanistan,\" he tells Dawn.com. ; Do you know that there are left -handed vehicles? How will I work there? If my work is finished here, I will find someone else, but no one knows me there. ”He says, taking out his POR card. 'This is my identity card, no matter what anyone says. Ziba is also irritated. She says, 'I will not go unless they put me on the bus. One of them is wearing a green and white hat on which a star is connected. All the pictures were made by the writer.

         "The system of life has been suspended in Balochistan for the past several weeks, with most of the highways connecting the province to other parts of the country, while mobile phone services have been suspended. Quetta, which is the provincial capital, is almost locked up and the administration is trying to prevent protesters from entering the city, led by Akhtar Mengal. In such a situation, the sovereignty of the state seems to be completely abolished. Even leaders like Akhtar Mengal and other Baloch nationalists who were once considered to be the last connection between the people and the state, now it seems that their trust in the political process is losing. The former provincial chief minister, who is the head of the Balochistan National Party (BNP) faction, has resigned from the parliament a few months ago and has attributed the apathy of the parliament to the 'insecurity' facing the people of Balochistan. He recently returned from the UAE, where he was living after his resignation from Parliament, and after the recent wave of terrorism and extremism in Balochistan, he is leading the 'Long March' against the arrest of the Baloch Solidarity Committee (BYC) leaders. The march is now joined with several other nationalist parties and central political parties. The growing public anger against state abuses has persuaded Baloch youth to support extremist groups. This disturbing trend can make nationalist parties completely irrelevant. In such a situation, the state will not have anything to do. But there is no understanding of the seriousness of the situation in the routes of power in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Instead, we are witnessing the increasing use of force to silence the sounds, and they are being forced to abandon the democratic path. In the context of growing violence and terrorism by militants, the crackdown against political opposition has made the province's situation very unpredictable. A broken provincial government, whose legal status is also questioned, has completely failed. It is evident that the real power is with the establishment, which only sees the situation with the 'security lens'. This has been a major reason for the people of the state to lose their hearts and minds. It certainly provides terrorist groups to work with more immunity. The recent wave of high -profile terrorist attacks across the province is also evidence of losing control of the state. According to some reports, 20 districts of the province are now influenced by the violence and political violence of the militants. The abolition of the administration has worsened the situation. According to reports, some ministers of the provincial cabinet cannot go to their constituencies despite heavy security. The recent hijacking of a passenger train and simultaneous terrorist attacks in different parts of the province clarify the growing capabilities of militant groups. This would not have been possible without local cooperation. The crackdown by security forces provides more recruits to these groups. The growing involvement of female fighters has made Baloch militancy more deadly. There have been many incidents of terrorist attacks by women suicide bombers, especially on security targets. Women are also leading the rights movement. For example, many people see Dr. Mahi Rang Baloch as the Right Movement as a torch path. Most women who are now leading the rights movement have their own stories that their families are suffering from state repression. The emergence of a new generation of young and educated Baloch resistance leadership has made the old guard politically irrelevant. The state now has to deal with them. But it seems that the province has no understanding of the rapidly changing political scenario. What is happening in Balochistan is the result of decades of state mismanagement, ignoring and depriving people of their basic political and economic rights. Increasing alienation and increasing separation, militant violence seems to be a reaction to the colonial methods and mentality of our ruling elite and the establishment. Security forces face the fifth Baloch uprising. Earlier in 1948, 59-1958, 63-1962, and 77-1973 there were four uprising. But this time the rebels appear to be more ready and they have the latest weapons and modern communication systems. After the last uprising, the province remained relatively stable and as a result of the restoration of democracy in 1988, the Baloch nationalists came into the mainstream. Although many of his demands regarding natural gas royalty and the province's natural resources were not met, democratic rule gave the Baloch a sense of political participation. The tensions began to rise in 2003 when the Musharraf government announced the plan for three new camps in the province. This idea did not go well with local political forces. The increasing deployment of security personnel further dissatisfied. In Balochistan, even the maintenance of law and order is mostly with the federally -controlled paramilitary forces. It has worsened the situation in addition to other matters. Even the present provincial government, which has been supported by the establishment, has no real power. There was also an idea that increasing terrorism and protests would be taken as a 'wake -up call' and would force the federal government and the establishment to sit with nationalist leaders and seek political solutions, but that did not happen. Instead, the government has set up a \"tough state\" committee headed by the Federal Home Minister. Now it is difficult to understand what it means. There are many questions about what the 'hard state' real means. The state can only be strengthened when the causes of people's dissatisfaction are eliminated, not to show. We can only hope to make better decisions, it is too late before it is. Read this post in English."

         "The National Security Committee meeting reaffirmed its commitment to not tolerate terrorism in Pakistan, and reiterated the commitment to spread tensions with all organizations with full force. In a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office after the National Security Committee, the 40th meeting of the National Security Committee was chaired by Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, attended by the concerned federal ministers, the chiefs of the Armed Forces and the heads of intelligence agencies. The statement said that the concept of 'national security' embraces economic security and that it is suppressed at national sovereignty and dignity without economic self -sufficiency or sovereignty. The meeting was informed that the meeting reviewed the country's economic situation and the challenges in a comprehensive manner that was especially faced by the people belonging to Pakistan's low income and middle class. The Federal Finance Minister gave the meeting a briefing on the Roadmap of Economic Stability, including the status of negotiations with global financial institutions, as well as a briefing on finding other financial sources based on mutual interest and providing relief to the public. A statement from the Prime Minister's Office said that the National Security Committee has agreed to concrete steps to strengthen the economy, which includes the importation of imports and illegal withdrawal of currency and preventing handicrafts. According to the statement, the meeting agreed that focus would be on improving agricultural and industrial production, especially to ensure food protection. In addition, alternative imports and employment opportunities will also be ensured. It was further agreed that it would be a priority to make public -friendly policies that would benefit the common man. It was further stated that it was also agreed to include all stakeholders to create a consensus for effective and fast economic recovery and roadmap. The statement of the National Security Committee said that the attempt to tackle the challenges of 30 million flood victims was informed that all resources were used to work on the restoration and reconstruction of flood victims with provincial governments and multi -financial institutions. The statement added that the security committee meeting also praised the ongoing relief efforts led by the Prime Minister and the federal units. The committee was informed about the country's security situation and especially the recent terrorist incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the statement said. The Prime Minister emphasized that the federal and provincial governments will patronize the fight against terrorism under the National Action Plan with the National Economic Development and National Internal Security Policy for the people. He said the armed forces would provide a full, safe and favorable environment. The statement said that no country will be allowed to provide a shelter or facility for terrorists and Pakistan protects all the rights of its citizens in this regard. The National Security Committee reaffirmed his commitment to not tolerate terrorism in Pakistan and reiterated his commitment to spread tensions or to deal with all organizations. The meeting regarding terrorism said that it would be dealt with in full force. The meeting said that there could be no compromise on the security of Pakistan and the full process of the state would be established in every corner of Pakistan. The Security Committee statement said that provincial Apex committees have also been restored and law enforcement agencies, especially the Anti -Terrorism Department, will be brought to the standard of fighting with the desired capacity. It should be remembered that at a meeting held on Friday, the National Security Committee had vowed to end terrorism with full force and postponed the meeting till Monday so that the decisions could be finalized keeping in view the proposals. The National Security Committee is the most important forum for foreign policy and national security decision -making, with senior civilian and military leadership participating in the meeting. It is unusual for the National Security Committee to continue for the second round, so it was believed that decisions would be made not only to tackle terrorism but also to strengthen the country's destructive economy. Government sources said that the civil and military leadership has decided that Pakistan, the most victims of terrorism in the world, have achieved peace after a long war on terror that began in 2001. He said that the state would not allow terrorism to be raised again as this peace was achieved by the sacrifice of thousands of Pakistani citizens. During the past few months, the law and order situation in the country has worsened, terrorist groups like the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan, ISIS and Gul Bahadur groups are conducting indiscriminate attacks across the country. In Balochistan, the rebels have also intensified their violent activities and has set up alliance with the banned TTP. The incident at the Investigation Center of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Anti -Terrorism Department in Bannu and the suicide bombing in Islamabad not only raised the alarm in the House but also worried many countries about the security of their citizens."

Addressing the video, Imran Khan said that a good time comes in the lives of the nations, a part of the high life, the big decision was made in April, despite the corona, our government's performance was excellent in Pakistan's history. Chairman PTI said that he (the present government) has pushed the domestic economy here today that today there are only two ways in the new year, a big difficult decision is to go to the IMF, the other is a difficult decision if we do not go to the IMF. He said that if he goes to the IMF, another wave of inflation will come, he has done the economy of the country, it has never happened in the history of our country, we used to read what the economic hit man does, he debts the country and then all the assets of the country are cheap. Imran Khan said that the country is going to prepare, inflation is coming now, we have no choice but to go to the IMF program. If we do not go to the IMF, we will default, it will bring more problems, which will come to us after going to the program. He said that the thieves imposed on us, we have to confront them, we do not run out, we have a new case every other day, we have not left the country, we have not run out, life is in danger. The former Prime Minister said that when the crisis comes, there is an opportunity to reform itself, fix our institutions, bring the rule of law in Pakistan, it is only one way to get out of the destruction that is coming in the way. The nation should stand that we want justice. Imran Khan said that when the floods came to Pakistan, we collected money for the flood victims, I have been collecting money for Shaukat Khanum for 30 years, Namal University and PTI for 17 years. Whatever money I collect, I do all the things transparent, I always have all the money, I have all the money. He said that we had decided that the money that would be collected would give us to all the provinces, Sindh government and NDMA were not giving data, we had decided to distribute one billion rupees in Sindh but the data was not available. The former Prime Minister said that we have one billion rupees, we need data. If we get data, we have decided that we will deliver money to 40,000 people. He said that I would like to tell my people that whenever there was a tragedy in our country, the nation gave heartfelt money which may not give the countries of the world. Later, Sania Nishtar said that people had asked to pay Rs 15 billion in 3 television so far Rs 4 billion 60 crore has come, out of which Rs 3 billion 60 crore has been spent, we have kept one billion rupees for Sindh. He said that we expect the survey in Sindh to be completed, the sooner they will give us the data, the sooner we will distribute one billion rupees to 40,000 people. He said that aid from credit card was unsuccessful on the basis of five different reasons, so no heavy amount of Rs 4 billion 30 crore could be received."

Speaking at a press conference after the All Parties Conference (APC) meeting in Peshawar, Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to take immediate steps to restore law and order in the province, otherwise the opposition parties in the province could consider a tough decision against the government. He said that the All Parties Conference, comprising leading political parties in the country, expressed concern over the ongoing wave of unrest, target killings, kidnapping for ransom and murder in the province, calling it the result of government incompetent and poor policies. Maulana Fazlur Rehman said that the APC makes it clear that there is nothing called government in the province while the robbers, robbers and extortionists have been given open leave due to which the people are vulnerable, but the government and its ministers are busy collecting goods.  He said that in the light of all the circumstances and events, the APC warns the government to take immediate steps to restore law and order in the province, otherwise the opposition parties in the province may consider making tough decisions against the government. He said that the APC expressed concern over the poor economic situation of the province, the highest debt of history, Iqbal Puri and the ongoing corruption in the province, making it clear that the occupying rulers for 9 years borrowed Rs 900 billion in 75 -year history. Head JUI -F, he said that no hospital, university or any other development projects have been laid in the province so far, so the provincial government and the chief minister will have to pay billions of rupees. He said that APCBRT, Malm Jabba, flour. The Chinese scandal and the prohibited funding call demands action against those involved. He said that in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, the helicopter bill was merely designed to acquit Imran Khan from NAB cases, which is condemned.  The PDM chief called on the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government to reduce the price of flour to relieve the people. Maulana Fazlur Rehman said that the APC termed the provincial government's alleged behavior regarding the constitutional status of the central government as a violation of the constitution and demands that the provincial government recognize the status of the federal government in every respect and refrain from unconstitutional measures. Responding to a question, he said how the central government is funding the provincial government while the Chief Minister is saying that we are going to dissolve the assembly, that is, if the federal government gives money and you dissolve the assembly, it is a matter of sinking the country."

         "price rise, food insecurity",
         "In Punjab, the owners of the mills have increased the price of flour to Rs 150 per kg while citizens in different districts of the province are also facing severe shortage of flour. According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, a 20kg flour bag in Rawalpindi is available for Rs. The situation is alarming in all the districts of Rawalpindi city, Kent and adjoining areas besides Murree and Rawalpindi, but Rawalpindi officials claim that the flour bags are available in all the grocery shops and markets. Last year, the district administration had registered more than 100 small flour mills in the district to issue wheat at the official level and under this the dough was to be sold at a lower price. President Floor Mill Dealers Association Zahoor Bhatti told Dawn that the department's food and district administration's negligence increased flour prices'. He said that more than a thousand floor mills in the province received a quota of wheat from the Punjab government which sold 100kg of wheat bag for Rs 10,800 and 80 kg bag of flour for Rs 5,700. Zahir Bhatti added that flour mills sell flour and semolina from wheat and sell it at expensive prices. The food department did not monitor the Flour Mills. The district administration said that flour is available in large quantities at all grocery stores, including flour tracking points across the district and no complaints of shortage or crisis in any area. Flour smuggling is being prevented at check posts located at seven different places administered by the Department of Food, where hundreds of flour bags are registered daily and cases against smugglers. In the districts of Muzaffargarh, Kot Edo and Rahim Yar Khan, long rows of buyers were seen at specific centers selling flour on subsidies, which is considered a sign of a more serious flour crisis. According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, people in Rahim Yar Khan had difficulty obtaining wheat flour after last week. Long rows of people were seen in places like Abbasia Bridge, Faisal Road, Shahbazpur Road, Ada Khanpur Chowk, Bypass Road and Abu Dhabi Road, where some Flour Mills have also set up flour sales centers. According to Chaudhry Maqsood Sindhu of the local currency association, there are more than 125 flour mills in the district but the shortage of flour remains. He said that this is a problem of demand and logistics, Flour Mills provides 75 bags of 10kg at a grocery store daily which are sold in an hour, the district food controller and the district administration have been lacking in distributing flour to the city's retailers. On the other hand, District Food Controller Malik Zaman Khan claims that 'retailers have received excess flour prices, we have filed an FIR against more than one retailers, which is trying to create artificial shortage, floor mills owners have a cabinet shortage of wheat. In Muzaffargarh and Kot Edo, 10kg of flour bags are priced between Rs 490 and Rs 648, flour is available in limited quantities and high prices in grocery shops and mills. Citizens protested, saying that the rise in prices has reduced the sale of flour while there is a severe shortage of subsidy flour in the market. In rural areas, milling flour owners are selling flour at higher prices; in cities, shops are not selling flour according to official rates."

According to a report published in the Dawn newspaper, a high -level body on Friday vowed to end terrorism with full force and postponed the meeting till Monday so that the decisions could be finalized keeping in view the proposals. Since it is quite unusual for the National Security Committee to continue for the second round, it is believed that decisions will be made not only to tackle terrorism but also to strengthen the country's destructive economy. A government source said that the civil and military leadership has decided that Pakistan, the most victim of terrorism in the world, has gained peace after a long war on terror that began in 2001. He said that the state would not allow terrorism to be raised again as this peace was achieved by the sacrifice of thousands of Pakistani citizens.  During the past few months, the law and order situation in the country has worsened, terrorist groups like the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan, ISIS and Gul Bahadur groups are conducting indiscriminate attacks across the country. In Balochistan, the rebels have also intensified their violent activities and has set up alliance with the banned TTP. The incident at the Investigation Center of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Anti -Terrorism Department in Bannu and the suicide bombing in Islamabad not only raised the alarm in the House but also worried many countries about the security of their citizens."

         "Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) consumers living in different parts of Karachi are complaining about lack of gas for cooking, though the company promised that gas load shedding would not be done during cooking hours but now the opposite is happening. According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, on December 11, the SSGC officially announced that domestic consumers will be provided with gas at a total of 8 hours, in the morning, afternoon and evening. However, now the situation is that complaints of lack of gas or lack of pressure from rich people to low -income palaces are coming to fruition. Sui Southern also appears helpless in this situation, while its spokesperson also acknowledged the problem of breakfast, lunch and gas pressure during dinner hours.  A resident of Scheme 33 told Dawn that there was no gas at home to make breakfast, gas pressure is very low, gas is so low that the stove is burning like a candle burning, the whole family, including my young children, has to spend on tea, biscuits while not so low gas pressure. Another resident of Scheme 33 Gulzar Hijri, located near Safura Goth, said that he was about to go home after going home and eat with his family in peace so that his wife's phone came to bring food from outside, not to cook or cook in the fridge. A resident of the Bhatai Colony located in Korangi Creek Cantonment said that the gas is coming, but often disappears at times when they need more, such as breakfast, lunch or dinner, which is a very strange and big problem. The worst situation facing gas shortage was also reported by a resident of Malir Kent, saying that the residents of the nearby residents have gas but not in our house, we complained but no benefit.  The woman said that there used to be loadshedding before, but gas was coming for cooking, there was no special time for load shedding, there was no gas in our house for two to three weeks, there was no gas during cooking hours. He said that I have to go to my relatives to cook or just make tea, I cannot boil water for drinking, I have to buy water, use electric rods to heat the water for bathing. For all these reasons, our expenses are doubled. According to spokesman SSGC, their aim is to protect consumers from suffering, but it is also true that gas resources are diminishing in the country. The spokesperson said, \"We are losing 10 to 20 percent of gas resources every year and has an effect. Whatever gas we have, our priority is to supply its cooking hours, so we announced a schedule for gas supply in the morning, afternoon and evening hours, but since all the people are using gas at these times, the gas is low."

         "Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has said that Pakistan and all neighboring countries want 'good relations' but Islamabad should refrain from making 'provocative and baseless' statements. Zabihullah Mujahid's response has come when the National Security Committee called on the Taliban government of Afghanistan without naming that no country would be allowed to provide a shelter or facility for terrorists and Pakistan protected all the rights of its citizens in this regard and said that they would not be able to tolerate it. Similarly, Defense Minister Khawaja Asif had stated that Afghanistan's land was constantly being used against Pakistan, though the Taliban had signed a Doha agreement that they would not allow their land to be used against any country. Khawaja Asif added that it was the responsibility of the Afghan interim government to prevent terrorists from spreading chaos. Defense Minister Khawaja Asif also rejected the Afghan Ministry of Defense's claim that the banned TTP is not present in Afghanistan, adding that TTP has no control over an inch of land in Pakistan, members of the banned group are entering Pakistan from Afghanistan. Earlier, Rana Sanaullah had said that if Afghanistan does not take action on TTP bases, then it has the right to attack if a terrorist group plans to attack another area in another area. Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement today that recent statements by Pakistani authorities are very sad. A spokesman for the Taliban government said that Pakistan also has a responsibility to take steps to overcome the situation, making baseless statements that create an atmosphere of distrust, which is not in any interest. Zabihullah Mujahid said that his government was trying not to use Afghanistan's land against Pakistan and Kabul is serious about achieving this goal. A spokesman for the Taliban government said that the UAE Islamia values ​​peace and stability in Afghanistan, and we want peace and stability throughout the region and will continue our efforts for this purpose. On the other hand, a spokesman for the Taliban government told the BBC Pashto that the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan leaders live in Afghanistan, not in Afghanistan. He said that we do not provide shelter to the banned TTP leaders but they come to Kabul to negotiate with the Pakistani delegation, they come to talk to Pakistan. Earlier, Rana Sanaullah said in an interview that in the first round of the National Security Committee, it was agreed that talks with the banned TTP were not a good option. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai responded to the statement, saying that Pakistan was facing the current situation because of its policies. He said that Islamabad should avoid threats and use of force and should adopt a decent policy and have good relations with Afghanistan. It is worth mentioning here that terrorist attacks in Pakistan have intensified, which is believed to be planned and directed by the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan (TTP) leaders in Afghanistan. Talks with the banned TTP and the government of Pakistan were held in Kabul, but on November 28, the TTP ended the ceasefire with the government in June and ordered its terrorists to attack nationwide. In Balochistan, the rebels have intensified their violent activities and has begun a regular alliance with the banned TTP. The incident at the Investigation Center of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Anti -Terrorism Department in Bannu and a suicide attack in Islamabad has not only rang the alarm in the passage of power, but many countries have also been worried about the security of their citizens."

Talking to the media, Maryam Aurangzeb said that today the white paper on the economy has been released by those who destroyed the people and the economy of Pakistan. They were not ashamed of issuing a white paper to the black -wing, black magic, who brought the country to the economic bankruptcy.  He said that today, in this white paper, first apologize to the people, laughing people between 2013 and 2018, making economic growth, inflation at the lowest level in history, destroying the country's economy. Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting said that he would give white paper to the people of Pakistan what kind of country I had found, white papers cannot white your black deeds, no white paper can white your economic catastrophe, no white paper will make your corruption and theft of the country. He said that from 2013 to 2018, the country was given to the PML -N to Imran Khan, he was growing at 6.1 %, it had the lowest levels of inflation in history, the C -Pack projects were successful in the country, Nawaz Sharif had made 14,000 MW of electricity. Maryam Aurangzeb said that inflation in the country was at 3.8 %, breaking the backbone of terrorism and giving Pakistan a peaceful, prosperous and developing country. He said that in the white paper, he also said that in 2018, there was Rs 35 kg flour and Rs 52 kg sugar. He also told the country that in 2018, gas, power shortage, more power generation was given to you. The Federal Minister said who would release the White Paper of May 2022 after 2018, in which the historic 45,000 billion loans were taken, who would tell the public? He said how would you tell the public that the power unit was raised to Rs 26 to Rs 26, is it listed in the white paper, which you have issued today. Maryam Aurangzeb said how would you tell how you stopped the C -Pack projects that were implemented by Nawaz Sharif, how would you tell that there was no country that was with you, whether they were China or Turkish investors, who did not pay any money in the country's plans, you did not even bother them. He said what do you think your white paper will cover your black actions and black mindset? Tell the people of Pakistan that terrorism has returned to this country between 2018 and 2022, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been your government for 9 years, who will issue a white paper of terrorism, anti -terrorism departments who cannot be formed? He said that you have to listen to the white paper that you have dealt with Kashmir, you destroyed the economy, prosperous, laughing Pakistan. The Federal Minister said that the white paper from 2018 to 2022 should be issued that all the projects of the country that were growing at 6.1 percent, you have stopped, the economic catastrophe has come in these four years. He said that the White Papers were released saying that we were busy dealing with Kashmir, was busy inflation in the country, was busy borrowing the country's historic loans, five were busy collecting diamonds of carat. Federal Minister for Information said that a white paper should release his 10 -year -old acts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, if a white paper issues the performance of a four -year federal and Punjab government, your black deeds will come to the people of Pakistan. \"We have made difficult decisions to save the country's economy,\" he said. Maryam Aurangzeb said, \"As long as the audio leaks have come up against you, issue a white paper on all of them. Tell the people of Pakistan what you have been doing for 4 years.\" He said that this is not a white paper, it is your black deeds, which is in front of the people of Pakistan. If gas does not come in the stove, it is a white paper against you."

         "Former Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan issued a white paper against the government and called for the upholding of elections and law and said that the solution to oust the country from this swamp is that Pakistan will have to run something that we have not run till date. Addressing a seminar organized by PTI on the occasion of issuing a 'white paper' on the economic situation of Pakistan, Imran Khan said that the entire nation is having a fear at the moment where Pakistan is going. He said that 7.5 million Pakistanis who were professionals have left the country in seven months and I have received a message from Jabal Ali that the Pakistanis have never invested in the last 7 months in Jabal Ali's industrial state. He said that the economy is linked to politics, no economy in the world can run in isolation so it has to be understood that all this is happening because of what background, without understanding it, there is no proper analysis and the right solution cannot suggest how the country will get out of the economic swamp. He said that the entire seat of the status quo agrees on one thing that the elections are not to be held and unfortunately the elections are the only solution. If we have to get out of this swamp, there is no choice without going to the IMF. The former Prime Minister said that the terms of the IMF will have the impact of poverty in this country and if it does not go, there are bad conditions, the only solution is the elections but they do not want and it is trapped in Pakistan. He said that our biggest problem is the current account deficit, that is, we have less dollars, his government has not made long -term plans. If the country does not increase its exports, how can it say that Pakistan will become a Tiger of Asia? He said that in the past we also made a noise regarding going to the IMF because going there brings the problem of sovereignty and you cannot make decisions and they give orders, their representatives sit there and tell them what to do. Imran Khan said that this has been happening for 30, 40 years and no one has thought of increasing exports, the biggest current account deficit was left by the PML -N government. \"In our era, the superstar came and the oil prices went up and then Corona came, and the problems increased for us. The $ 3 billion coal vaccine had to be purchased, which was unusual,\" he said. He said that the National Security Committee meeting said that a national consensus on the economy and others should be created and very interestingly that the dollar is going out of the country. He said that the media propaganda against us was so much that when the cabinet meeting was kept in the cabinet meeting, the cabinet members refused to accept, the rate was 6 % in the last two years. He said that in the history of Pakistan, the dictators should be removed, the US dollars coming to Ayub Khan in Seto and Santo came to the Afghan war in the time of Zia -ul -Haq and then killed 80,000 people in the fight against terrorism. The PTI chairman said, \"We had discovered 3 million 40 million new taxpayers or were 4 million, we sat down with Nadra and used the artificial intelligence that they had lived, brought the track and trace system so that the tax was impossible to hide the tax. \"In 3 years, we created 55 million jobs and planned to move forward,\" he said. Talking about the steps of the federal government, he said that the prices of flour, electricity, petroleum, onions, tomatoes, ghee and pulses increased by 100 to 200 percent in 50 years. He said that so far 1.5 million textile laborers have lost jobs. In March last year, textiles were saying that we are not getting laborers in Faisalabad and have to get out of the outside and now 1.5 million laborers are unemployed from the same textile industry. Regarding external remittances, he said that exports and remittances have started to decline by 2 billion every month and foreign exchange was 16.4 in March and today has reached 5.7. He said that the dollar has reached 260, there are also terms of the IMF, it requires political stability to get out of it and elections should be held. The former Prime Minister said that Pakistan is facing a horrific scene right now, on the one hand unemployment and inflation on the other is very dangerous to the country. He said that it should be hoped that a government comes from the mandate and when the people are standing behind, they make difficult decisions, difficult decisions cannot be made. If the IMF will ask them difficult decisions, it will not be easy for them to do so. He said that the most important thing in Pakistan is the supremacy of the law, the economy is linked to the supremacy of the law. He said that unfortunately, when you came to the power that General Bajwa had, he believed that he was every art and he came to everything and then talk about focusing on the economy. Imran Khan said, \"The solution is that Pakistan will have to run something that we have not run till date and we will have to take the same steps. We have never established the rule of law, martial law comes, the law breaks down and the weakness of these two families is not to strengthen the institutions.\" He said that elections are the first step and the rule of law is the second step. Third, we will have to rescue the major corporations of the government as they are eating a lot of money at the moment, then our governance system will have to change and bring merit. The former Prime Minister said that we have to lift the small and middle industries because it is our backbone, tourism is a major sector of Pakistan and the special economic zones can be relocated from China. He said that without the rule of elections and the rule of law, no one can hardly remove Pakistan at this time, we will have to make major changes and now establishing the rule of law in Pakistan has become inevitable."

Addressing a seminar organized by PTI on the occasion of issuing a white paper on the economic situation of Pakistan, former Finance Minister Shaukat Tareen said that the PML -N government overwhelmed the rupee while the world underwent currency. Former Finance Minister Shaukat Tareen said that the PML -N government had left a $ 19.2 billion current account deficit for us while the reserves were $ 9.4 billion. He said that when the PML -N came to the government, imports were up to $ 25 billion, but imports reached $ 22 billion as the rupee was strengthened, which means imports decreased. Ishaq Dar said that when our imports were $ 25 billion in 2013, Bangladesh's imports were $ 27 billion and when some imports were tried in 2018, it was still up to $ 24.9 billion, but at that time Bangladesh imports were $ 37 billion. He said that since the rupee was strong, imports increased due to cheapness and in the same way, the nation got $ 33 billion in five years. The former finance minister said that this has happened because of keeping the rupee strong but is still saying that the rupee has to be kept strong but instead of keeping the rupee strong, keep where it is placed. Shaukat Tareen said that the PML -N government's financial debt was 7.6 %, the debt was 64 %. \"We had increased the debt by 18 trillion, but then our GDP had increased by 72 percent and you (the Legacy government) had lost 64 percent of the GDB and despite the corona virus, we left GDP 66 percent,\" he said. Shaukat Tareen said that when the PTI came to the government, the current account deficit was $ 12 billion and then it had to lend up to $ 12 billion. We got a $ 32 billion prescription. He said that Imran Khan is a charismatic personality but he does not spread his hands in front of anyone because he is ashamed because when I went to Saudi Arabia with him, I saw how much he was suffering from the help of default oil from the Saudi Wali Ahad and then I kept it. Shaukat Tareen said that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is mostly affiliated with Western countries and when we have good relations with these countries, there is an easy program when relations are not good. \"We have made progress in the era when their wars with the United States have fought because Ayub Khan joined Seto and on the other hand, when we joined the war in Afghanistan in 1997, what was our job because it was a dispute between the US, Russia, Afghanistan and Saudi,\" he said. He said that 80,000 people were martyred by joining the war and then Pervez Musharraf joined us in the war and our growth rate increased in all periods but after that, only Imran Khan's growth rate was 5.74 in the last two years. He said that the PTI government increased the tax acquisition from 37 billion to 6.15 trillion, which means a tax of Rs 1500 billion was collected in one year. Shaukat Tareen said that when we came to the government, the reserves were $ 9.8 billion, which increased to $ 16.4 billion in March, which has risen to $ 5.7 billion today. He said that the present government is alleging that we have suspended the contract with the IMF but this is not the fact because in February we took money from the IMF and the December data was being reviewed and then in March, we had a dialogue, so the government should stop accusing us of all this. Shaukat Tareen criticized Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, saying, \"On what basis did you say that the financial loan would be 10 percent while the financial loan was 2.6 trillion loans in nine months and in three months it would be 6.4.\" Will He said that after the current account deficit, the rupee started to fall, the stock market started declining and the rupee we had lost 178 reached 250. Shaukat Tareen said that the IMF withdrew on Ishaq Dar's talk and said that unless the figures were told, no more money would be paid, so the IMF stopped the money because of our inconsistency. Talking about the performance of the mixed government, Shaukat Tareen said that now the investigation rate has fallen, the dollar has started to rise, which has led to the inflation rate to 25 % and the sensitive price index has increased to 45 %, the business has started to shut down, the agriculture raft has drowned. \"I am predicting that the growth rate of 6 percent has become negative this year,\" he said. He said that 1.5 million people have been unemployed from the tickets industries while other industries are also shutting down. Shaukat Tareen said that the government now has to make payments to the banks, after which the foreign exchange reserves will be further reduced. The former minister said that the IMF says Pakistan's debt is doubled with its target in six months. Talking about tax, he said that the tax is increased by 15 % while inflation is more than 25 %, which means that taxes are 9 % negative. He said that if the IMF program is launched then it will have strict conditions in which the revenue will have to collect more, the exchange rate will have to be left loose and if they do not recognize the IMF, it will still be the same which will increase inflation and poverty."

In a statement issued by the provincial government over the approval of the second amendment bill 2022 regarding the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ministers (salary, allowance and privileges), the provincial government was criticized, saying that the purpose of approving the bill by the opposition parties was to misuse PTI chairman Imran Khan in a case of misuse of Imran Khan.\nTo save from NAB. Speaking at a press conference after the All Parties Conference meeting in Peshawar, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, president of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) and the head of Jamiat Ulema -e -Islam (F), said that when the Chief Minister was asking to dissolve the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, how to release the federal fund. Maulana Fazlur Rehman said that the Pakistan Democratic Movement did not know how many big and serious challenges it would face after the PTI government was demolished. Responding to a question about the current challenges facing the country, he said, \"We did not know that we were caught in the swamp, the more we struggle to get out, the more we get trapped, he said,\" The country is on the verge of bankruptcy but the current government has negotiated with the International Fund. \" Maulana Fazlur Rehman blamed the former PTI government at the center responsible for the current deteriorating situation, saying that the center is being attacked by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab governments on two sides and the problems of the federal government are being increased. Maulana Fazlur Rehman said that the All Parties Conference makes it clear that there is nothing called government in the province while the robbers, robbers and extortionists have been given open leave due to which the people are vulnerable, but the government and its ministers are busy collecting goods."

         "Foreign Minister and Chairman PPP Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that what happened last year in Kabul has a history, Tehreek -e -Taliban Afghanistan is a fact while the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan is a temptation. Talking to the media in Dadu, Bilawal Bhutto said that in the previous regime, it was decided to release the terrorists involved in the tragedy APS, I was still calling it a foolish act, we had cleared Pakistan from terrorism, who makes such decisions after winning the war. He said that what has happened in Kabul has a history, Tehreek -e -Taliban Afghanistan is a fact, the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan is a temptation, we have defeated them by confronting them, but we have also released their prisoners from here and their prisoners in Afghanistan are offered to host them in Pakistan. Bilawal Bhutto said that Imran Khan says that we had to set up 50,000 fighters in Pakistan, the importer of us was importing terrorism. This is the biggest crime of Imran Khan. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, terrorists are rising under their nose but they are trying to hide the issue of Pakistan. There is where terrorism is raising its head again. He said that at the meeting of the National Security Committee, we have decided that we do not accept Imran Khan's policy, we will establish the writ of the constitution in Pakistan, we will take action against the terrorists, the peaceful people are not ready to accept the terrorists, the government or the people. The Foreign Minister said that Imran Khan has a lot of desire for premature elections but he has failed at every opportunity, he was claiming to hold a long march twice and he was claiming to hold premature elections but he failed. He said that the opposition of Imran Khan's premature elections is not yet visible because when it comes time to resign from the assemblies, people like his party vice -chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Pervez Khattak disappear, many other members are not accepting their resignation. He said that I think it was Allah's decision that we had to oust this incompetent prime minister before the flood came, fortunately the chain went on and we succeeded in it, I became the Foreign Minister of this country and I belonged to an area that was affected by the flood, even if he was not affected by Imran Khan. He said that the advice to Imran Khan is that the parliament should come and play his role. If he does not remain the prime minister for six months, what will the resurrection come? Responding to a question regarding the talks between the MQM and the PPP, Bilawal Bhutto said, \"We have achieved enough things with the MQM, many issues have been disagreed and there will be ahead, but I want us to work on things in which we get our views.\" \"We had an agreement with the MQM and we want to go ahead under the same agreement to make the municipal system be strengthened. We are ready to talk about other issues, but some people in my party have the reservations that the local elections in Karachi have been postponed many times, but the political issues are not affected,\" he said. He said that when the flood came, the first phase of the municipal elections in Sindh had passed but the winning candidates could not take oath and could not help the people of their constituencies despite taking votes. If they took the oath, they could help their people in the flooded areas. Chairman PPP said that we are ready to go with all parties, including MQM, we are just objected to 'delay' in the municipal elections which we will continue to discuss. He said that political stability in Pakistan only came from 2007 to 2018, before and after the country has never had political stability. During this time, the policy under which we removed the country from political instability is called Imran Khan Makka, now political instability is because a fascist was imposed on this country. He said that if he wants political stability, Imran Khan becomes a democratic politician and comes to Parliament. If he does not do so, we have the treatment. He added that there is a economic crisis in the country but at the moment we are not in danger of default, the person responsible for all this is the person who has embraced the economy with his own hands to save his chair. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that the flood was very historic in Pakistan and to this day the flood victims are in trouble. From the UN to Sharm El Sheikh, the whole world is saying that Pakistan was drowned in the flood, the world has not seen yet, it is not an example that one -third of the country is drowned. He said that this is the resurrection before the Day of Judgment, we are going through this natural disaster, there is still water in some areas of Sindh and Balochistan, where the water has come out, destruction is destruction, there has been a crisis in every sector including agriculture and houses. He said that health infrastructure has also been badly destroyed, education has been damaged not only in Sindh but also in the rest of the areas but only 50 % of the educational institutions are destroyed in Sindh, resources are low, it will take time to fulfill the mission of flood rehabilitation. He said that after launching a flood victims program in January, aid will continue, road shows are being held for flood victims, the government is borrowing $ 2 billion from Sindh World Bank."

Yes, we are objected to 'delays' in just the elections, which we will continue to discuss.

According to the Dawn Newspaper Cairport, Advocate Omar Ijaz Gilani, in his request, also requested the National Commission for Human Rights to declare that seeking asylum seekers, especially the Afghan Human Rights Defnder (AHRD), deserves some rights, and they have the protection of the Pakistani Constitution and the Pakistani Constitution. The petition has requested the National Commission for Human Rights to direct the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to complete the proceedings on the petitions filed by foreigners based in Pakistan and decide on them, especially on the requests that are filed by Afghan Human Rights Defnder. The petition has asked the NCHR to order the federal government to protect asylum seekers in Pakistan, especially the Afghan Human Rights Defnder, to protect all the basic human rights with Article 4 of the Constitution, along with various provisions of the Constitution.  The petition states that the National Human Rights Commission, the National Data and Registration Authority (NADRA) and the UNHCR should also issue instructions for refugees living in Pakistan to speed up, facilitate the registration process. It added that the federal government should contact all concerned federal and provincial law enforcement agencies to prevent asylum seekers from seeking asylum in Pakistan. The petition cited the statement of Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Aam Memon in which he said that 129 Afghan female refugees in the province, along with 178 children, were behind bars. The petition states that after the collapse of Kabul, thousands of Afghan Human Rights defenders were forced to flee the country, leaving their loved ones and properties, many of them taking refuge in Pakistan.  They are currently living in exile in Pakistan, they have been living in Pakistan for more than a year. They were not provided any documents that could provide them with legal identity and therefore their future is uncertain, most of them have expired visas and they are waiting for their renewal. UNHCR says interviews for refugees have been delayed for more than a year, while without interviews, the agency cannot declare refugees. The petition states that the human rights situation has worsened since the coming of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, while the country is no longer safe for human rights activists as their past engagements and activities are considered against the basic ideology of the new government."

According to a report published in the Dawn newspaper, the senior police officer told Dawn that Maulana Hidayat -ur -Rehman was not present in Gwadar so he could not be arrested yet. It is to be remembered that during the violent protests in Gwadar, a policeman was killed during a firing by the protesters. A local administration released a local journalist in progress in the incident. A local journalist, including a local journalist, was arrested under Section 3 of the 16 Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) and sent to the Turbat District Jail. However, the Balochistan Union of Journalists and local journalists of Gwadar protested against the arrest of Obaidullah, a local journalist working for the Urdu newspaper in Karachi, which was later released by the local administration, but 15 other people have not been released yet.

At the meeting, Abdul Aziz Aqeel said that the people of Gwadar will be provided with all possible facilities as it is their right and the government will take immediate steps in this regard. He added that law enforcement agencies are taking steps to ensure law and order in the city. The Chief Secretary said that the protesters in the city had taken the city hostage for several days, causing financial loss to traders and people.

The provincial government had tried to hold talks with the protesters in a protest led by the Haq two movement, but the situation had become very serious in late December following the death of a policeman by unknown assailants during the protest. The day before the police officer's death failed, the two movement protesters surrounded the police after negotiations with police protesters failed. When the situation became serious, the government imposed section 144 in the city under which more than five crowds were banned in the city, while police used force to disperse the protesters and arrested more than 100 protesters."

According to a state news agency APP report, Federal Minister for National Food Security Tariq Bashir Cheema said at a press conference in Islamabad that the daily requirement of 40 Flour Mills in Islamabad is 38 thousand bags of 20kg. He said that the Punjab government was not providing the required quantity, which resulted in a shortage of 17,000 bags daily and Punjab failed to meet the target of wheat procurement this year.  The Federal Minister said that since flour mills are shopping from the open market to meet the shortage of flour, the price of flour is increasing. He demanded that the government provide the required amount to the Flour Mills in Punjab Islamabad. He said that there are 38 points in Islamabad where the government is providing flour at a lower price to provide relief to the people. According to the report, the federal government's delay in the announcement of wheat relief price, he said that the Sindh government has fixed the wheat relief price of Rs 4,000 per 40 kg which is very high. Tariq Bashir Cheema said that the matter will be resolved soon in a meeting between Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.  He said that the provincial governments should take responsibility and take steps to ensure food security and control prices. He said that wheat flour mills across the country are less than their capacity, which is causing prices to be artificially high so the provincial governments should take action against them. The Federal Minister said that there is no shortage of wheat in any province, the provinces have enough storage but they are not releasing them. \"We imported wheat for them at the behest of the provinces and if the provinces contacted us, we will meet their needs,\" he said. He said that there are plenty of strategic reserves to meet Afghanistan's demand, smuggling will not be allowed and if a country needs wheat, it should approach the government. He said that the federal government has spent billions of rupees through the Benazir Income Support Program for the restoration and resettlement of flood -affected families despite financial compulsions. Tariq Bashir Cheema said, \"Our rules do not allow GMO products to be imported because they are harmful to health, before 2015, GMO was not part of the soybean polytheistic feed but its alternative is available.\""

         "Federal Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah has said that efforts are being made to bring the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to the table, but the basic prerequisite for this is to surrender and submit themselves to the constitution and the law. Addressing a press conference with IG Police Nasir Akbar Khan in Islamabad, Federal Home Minister Rana Sanaullah said that the meeting of the National Security Committee was committed to zero tolerance against terrorism, not only will Zero tolerance against terrorism will be taken but steps will be taken to avoid terrorism. He said that it was decided that all the provincial CTDs and especially the CTDs of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should be given federal support and training opportunities and their condition should be done so that they are in a position to play an effective role against terrorism. The Federal Home Minister said that there was a concept that the CTD's mobile structure should be established at the federal level as the National CTD so that all four CTDs could be better contacted with Gilgit -Baltistan and Azad Kashmir. He said that Afghanistan is a reality and the Taliban government there is a fact and likewise efforts are being made to bring the TTP to the table and try to be tried. He said that we need to deal with these things in such a long time in this regard that we are minimal and even come to the fore that minor incidents will be reported and work will be seen in this regard. Responding to a question on the banned TTP threat, Rana Sanaullah said, \"We did not say at all that we want to attack Afghanistan or want to attack someone there, but I said that if a terrorist is taking a position in a place, after which he will attack or terrorize it, we can respond to international law.\" He said that the National Security Committee meeting regarding the Afghan government has taken a formal decision to talk to the Afghan government instead of talking to anyone else and we will talk to them. He said that as far as the threat is concerned, it is specifically given to someone and sometimes to someone, but there is a general risk, we are taking the steps taken first. The Federal Minister said that the Islamabad police have been able to fulfill their responsibilities better than ever. He said that the Islamabad police demanded that their demands were fulfilled if their salary was equal to the Punjab Police and their demands would be fulfilled and those who were left would also be fulfilled. He said that the issue of attack on Parliament was raised on the media, it was a cause for spreading panic and it is also an element of terrorism that these suspects have also been arrested if people are terrorized. He said that an investigation was underway in this regard and as soon as the investigation is completed, the media will be told. Rana Sanaullah said that two CTD officers were killed and one of them was personally known to Naveed Sial, who completed the big tasks by playing their lives but yesterday they were attacked and they were martyred. He said it was a great loss and the state's counter -terrorism war. He said that there are efforts that cannot be made public but it should not be assumed that nothing is happening in terms of counter -terrorism but much is happening because the geographical boundaries of Pakistan are possible because of the sacrifices of these martyrs. On a question about allegations and audio leaks on showbiz people, the Federal Home Minister said, \"There are some people in the audio leaks whose audio is basically bad, they are fine, but they want to do with this country and the nation.\" He said, \"The nation should be aware of people whose role is so low and they say that the nation should recognize them if we consider us a leader.\" He said, \"They have a legal and moral aspect and if it comes to the role of a man, it is to say that there is no legal action. Nothing happened. Rana Sanaullah said, \"either challenge someone and say that it is wrong, we have made it forensic on our own. All things are right.\" On the question of allegations against military officers, the federal minister said that it was legitimate for politicians to the extent that politicians are free to defend, respond and counter allegations, but two years after leaving service from a government agency, and especially the law enforcement or the military, they are not allowed to defend them. It is to be noted that the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has announced to consider taking concrete steps against the two major coalition parties of the ruling coalition and the PPP in a threatening statement. The statement said in the name of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari that if these 2 parties remain firm on their position, then action would be taken against their leading people and the people should refrain from approaching such prominent people. It is to be noted that the threatening statement by the TTP has been issued at a time when the law and order situation in the country has worsened in the last few months, shortly after the TTP's announcement of the ceasefire on November 28, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have resulted in an unusual attack in December. Pakistan is constantly pressing Afghan authorities to take action against terrorist groups after the country has increased terrorist attacks. On December 30, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah spoke to the private channel 'Express News', saying that there was no way to clear the areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in which TTP presence is. He said that if Afghanistan does not take action on the TTP bases, then under international law, it is the right that if a terrorist group plans to attack another area in another area, it can be attacked. Meanwhile, the Taliban government of Afghanistan was urged without a nomination at the National Security Committee meeting that no country would be allowed to provide a shelter or facility for terrorists, Pakistan protected all the rights of its citizens in this regard. Yesterday, 3 January Chairman PPP Bilawal Bhutto had said that Tehreek -e -Taliban Afghanistan is a fact while the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan is a temptation. We have decided at a meeting of the National Security Committee that we do not accept Imran Khan's policy, we will establish a constitution writ in Pakistan and no terrorists will be ready for terrorists."

         "Inflation continues to rise in the country and the price of poultry meat in the capital Islamabad has reached Rs 650 per kg on Tuesday, after which traders and poultry farmers have warned that the availability of poultry meat at a relatively low rates can be made and the meat crisis continues soon. According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, he added that the price of poultry meat can reach more than Rs 800 per kg or almost red meat while living broiler poultry in Islamabad is selling up to Rs 370 per kg. On the other hand, the Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA) and the All Pakistan Solvent Extractors Association (APSEA) have threatened that if the government did not immediately recognize the demands of their two industries from destruction, protests would be held in Lahore, the capital of Punjab on Thursday. From October 2022, the prices of poultry products began to rise rapidly when customs officials stopped delivery of GMO soybean, which comes mostly from the United States and Brazil. Due to legal issues, 9 shipments have been trapped at the port so far and the situation has not improved despite the intervention of the top US diplomat. Imports of genetically converted biology (GMO)) and its products are not allowed in Pakistan as Pakistan is the signator of a global campaign against GMO seeds. Food Minister Tariq Bashir Cheema recently told the National Assembly panel that Pakistan only allows non -GMO soybean imports, claiming that the US representative urged him to clearance of soybean ships trapped at the Karachi port. It is worth mentioning here that the use of soybeans is an important and key component of poultry feed, due to 'illegal shipments', the feed mills between the country are unable to meet the growing demand, which has led to a huge increase in food prices, the price of 50 kg chicken feed has increased to Rs 2000 after only 3 months. On the other hand, the industry -related people also criticized the role of eggs and feed mills due to rising chicken prices. Punjab Poultry Farmers Association President Mian Tariq Javed criticized the top leadership of the Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA) for allegedly making money through illegal imports, trying to monopolize soybean supply and banning other imports. He said the issue was genetically related to the import of modified soybean, the law was not allowed under the law but it was imported without notice. Meanwhile, PPA officials refused to react to the allegations that senior members of the association were involved in the illegal import of GMO soybean. Interestingly, two different inquiries conducted by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) revealed a day's broiler chickens, as well as PPA collusion and price fixing at poultry feed mills. PPA members obtained a stay order from the Islamabad High Court for 10 years against an inquiry and in May 2021, Fed Mills also received a stay order against the CCP's showcase proceedings from the Lahore High Court. The issue of soybean shipments trapped at the port has become complicated, while importers and the Ministry of Food Security officials disagree. The issue of genetic modified organs seeds falls under the scope of climate change, the two ministries believe that Pakistan, like most European Union countries, is the signing of an agreement against GMO seeds. However, the All Pakistan Solvent Extractors Association (APSEA) supported the import of GMO seeds, which is of the view that the United States, Brazil, Argentina and other exporters developed GMO soybeans and feeds. APSEA leader Nawab Shahzad Ali said that the European Union is also importing GMO soybean from the United States for poultry and livestock food. We also have to find a way in this regard. On the other hand, PPA and APSEA claimed that they were paying $ 4 million daily for the stopped ships, while poultry price increased due to non -availability of soybeans in just one month. Shahzad Ali appealed to the Prime Minister to give immediate interference and a delegation of associations to meet the time to meet, warning that if the government did not stop economic catastrophe, he would be forced to protest in Thokar Niaz Baig on Thursday, January 5."

         "water availability, economic crisis, price rise, food insecurity",
         "Balochistan has requested the federal government to provide 6 million bags of wheat on an emergency basis due to severe wheat shortage and unusual increase in flour prices. According to the Dawn Newspaper Carport, Food Minister Balochistan Zamrak Khan Pir Alizai said that the Food Department of Balochistan has only a few days' wheat reserves, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and National Food Security Ministry provide cheap flour to the people of Balochistan. It may be recalled that Balochistan had also requested the Punjab Government to provide 6 lakh bags of wheat two months ago but despite the promise of Chief Minister Punjab Pervez Elahi, the grain has not yet been provided to Balochistan. \"We were expecting a supply of 2 million tonnes of wheat from Punjab two months ago, but it could not reach Balochistan due to inter -provincial ban on wheat transport,\" said a senior food department official.  Zamrak Khan Pir Alizai confirmed the wheat crisis in the province and said that Islamabad should come forward to help the province, Balochistan could not achieve wheat in the previous harvest season for various reasons, including the heavy losses caused by the floods in the wheat cultivation areas. \"We can get only 3 million tonnes of wheat against the target of 1 million tonnes,\" he said. The Food Department also received 2 million tonnes of wheat from the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation. He said that he met Chief Minister Punjab Pervaiz Elahi for the supply of wheat and also contacted the government of Sindh.  He assured that \"we will not leave the people of Balochistan alone in this crisis and use all available resources to ensure proper supply of flour. Chief Minister Balochistan Mir Abdul Qudos Bizenjo is also trying to resolve the issue.\" However, sources say that despite the timely decision to procure the cabinet of 1 million tonnes of wheat, the Food Department could not achieve the target of procurement from Naseerabad division and a large quantity of wheat was purchased by private buyers of Sindh. It should be noted that the price of 20kg of flour bags has increased by Rs 300 in the last few days and now it is being sold for Rs 2600 in the open market. Flour Mills owners have accused the Food Department that the mills were not provided with wheat according to the fixed quota, which created a crisis and prices increased.  According to the mills owners, about 18 mills operating in Quetta need 25,000 bags of wheat daily to meet their needs. Chairman Pakistan Flour Mills Association Syed Nasir Agha said that the food department has only a few days of stock. If the wheat is not arranged, the situation will get worse. \"Millers are buying wheat from the open market, where the price of 100kg bags per 100kg has reached Rs 11,000, we have no choice but to increase flour prices,\" he added."

         "The trend of rising wheat flour and poultry prices across the country has further increased the difficulties of consumers disturbed by inflation, while the prices of these goods have seen a sharp rise over the past few days. According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, during the fresh wave of inflation in Karachi, where the prices of different types of flour reached Rs 140 to Rs 160 per kg, the price of the chicken rose to Rs 420 per kg. One of the reasons for the rise in prices is also a systematic, efficient system for sellers, raising custom prices. Floor millions have also now raised flour number 2.5 and refinement flour/flour at Rs 130 and Rs 140 per kg, while the price was Rs 115 and Rs 118 in the last week of December. Due to the absence of any effective, organized procedure of pricing and delay in clearance of the main raw material of poultry feed from the port, stakeholders have raised live chicken prices from Rs 420 per kg, which is from Rs 380 to Rs. There were rupees. In the wholesale market, the dough number is now available in the last week of December 2.5, compared to Rs 113, now Rs 136 to Rs 138 per kg, the price of Fine flour and flour is currently the wholesale price of Rs 142 per kg, which was Rs 115 last month. The retail price of dough number 2.5 is now between 140-150, while Fine flour and flour are being sold at Rs 150 and milling flour at Rs 160 per kg. Millers and wholesalers are telling the price of 100kg of wheat bags in the open market, 12,000 to 12 thousand 5 hundred, which was Rs 10,600 in the last week of December, it was Rs 8,3000 in November. Retailers say that the Millers have released new rates of branded fine flour, according to which the price of Ashrafi flour was 5kg and 10kg bags, respectively, Rs 775 and Rs 1,530 respectively, which was Rs 700 and Rs 1400 last week. Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association Chairman Rauf Ibrahim said that there were still two months to come to the new wheat crop in Sindh, alleging that serious steps were not taken to overcome rising prices. He said how many people are getting subsidized flour Rs 65 per kg? This subsidy is only for the floor millionaires and the provincial government, it is not benefiting the crushed users. On the other hand, Pakistan Flour Mills Association Sindh Zone Chairman Aamir Abdullah said that the flour is available to 30 to 40 percent of the people of Karachi at Rs 65 per kg. The Pakistan Flour Mills Association has talked to the Provincial Secretary Food, Commissioner Karachi and Deputy Commissioners about increasing the number of cell points in the city to improve the availability of subsidized flour to the public. Aamir Abdullah said that wheat quota should be increased for floor millions. He regretted that the money snatching at the cell points was increasing, adding that the flu -milliers have urged the Commissioner and Secretary Food to provide special security at various cell points. He said that Pasco has also been requested to provide wheat directly to the floor mills. He said that there is no shortage of flour in the city but its prices are still increasing. The poultry without bone meat is being sold for almost Rs 800 to 900 per kg equivalent to beef. The rates raised by the Retarers are contrary to the prices issued by the Sindh Poultry Wholesalers Association (SPWA). Sindh Poultry Wholesalers Association General Secretary Kamal Akhtar Siddiqui said that retail prices should be between Rs 370 to Rs 380 per kg on the basis of a rate of Rs 360 to Rs 364 while the meat rate is fixed at Rs 550 to 600, but usually the rates are different in terms of the area. Claiming a 35 % reduction in poultry production during the last 2 months, he said that rising poultry prices have also affected its sales. Kamal Akhtar Siddiqui said that due to lack of GMO soybean mail, poultry feed is being made with other components, which is also going up, which will take 42 days instead of 35 days in the coming days."

In today's peace march in Wana, various walks of life, including political and social workers, businessmen and youth, participated in large numbers, raising white flags and banners, especially supporting the restoration of peace in the tribal districts and chanting slogans against the growing wave of terrorism. The protests are taking place in Wana, South Waziristan, when terrorism is raising once again in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.

Mohsin Dawar paid tribute to the people of South Waziristan for standing against terrorism. It is to be noted that for the past several months, terrorism has increased in Pakistan once again, where terrorist operations and security forces have been attacked in different parts of the country, which is clearly conceived that the instructions are issued by the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan. The banned TTP recently announced the termination of the ceasefire from the Pakistani government and directed its fighters to conduct terrorist operations across the country. The banned TTP is ideologically linked to the Afghan Taliban, which launched more than one hundred terrorist operations across the country in a short period of time as tensions with the TTP's Pakistan government in August 2022 and the TTP announced the end of the ceasefire on November 28. Security forces killed 11 militants, including a key commander of the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan, in an operation in South Waziristan yesterday. In addition, five separate attacks were also injured in two separate attacks in Lakki Marwat and Dera Ismail Khan. As soon as terrorism has begun to raise its head, citizens from all over the province have taken to the streets in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and demanding further steps from the government. Similarly, thousands of citizens took to the streets to restore peace in Bajaur yesterday."

Shahbaz Sharif said that when the Corona virus came, the price of gas in the market was $ 2 per unit, but this (Imran Khan) man was sitting on the leg as he had no attachment to the Pakistani people. He said that if this person had been attacked by the people, he would have abused and retaliated, leaving oppression and planning public service. He said that I had thought a few days ago that I did not see Imran Khan's greater Mohsin, a hypocrite and a disbeliever in my life, and his words and speeches made it clear that a greater Mohsin was born in Pakistan. The Prime Minister said that I have nothing to do with how former soldier Qamar Javed Bajwa helped him and all that is coming out today. He said that the person who took over Imran Niazi with full force and for four years, the Pakistan institution had put all the powers and abilities so that Imran Niazi would somehow succeed and of course he believed that Pakistan should move forward and develop. He said that the organization made all the efforts that Imran Niazi succeed and Pakistan should develop in this way, but unfortunately Imran Niazi's unfortunately despite the full support of the failed prime minister and those who seated him on the seat of power are blames him today. Shahbaz Sharif said that when we took over the government, we paid a huge price because we knew that economic conditions were bad but I had no idea that Imran Khan had destroyed everything. He said that Imran Niazi drowned the pack of C -pack and made allegations of corruption on Chinese companies, ie a country invested $ 30 billion and instead accused them of thanking them, which China was very angry with. Talking about the decisions made on energy saving, the Prime Minister said, \"We have discussed it in the cabinet for the past several days and decided to shut down the markets quickly so that energy saving.\" \"I also talk about the traders, they are the backbone of the economy but the difficulty has come, so the businessmen have joined hands and request that the government support the government in difficult times so that the power will be saved, which will save the dollar.\""

         "Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has said that the focus of the world has been diminished from the flooded Pakistan but water is still standing in many areas of the country including Sindh and Balochistan. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said that last year's flood crisis, 1,700 people were killed and 30 million affected in the flood crisis last year. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif's aforementioned article was published on January 9 before the International Conference on Climate Resilience Pakistan in Geneva, and the government is hosted by the Government of Pakistan and the United Nations. The purpose of the conference is to unite government representatives, public and private sectors and civil society representatives from all over the world to cooperate with the people and the government in relation to the devastating floods in 2022. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said in his article that \"international attention has diminished but water has not diminished, most areas of Sindh and Balochistan are still drowning.\" \"The number of people with food insecurity in Pakistan has doubled to a crore 40 million and the other 90 million have fallen victim to extreme poverty,\" he said. \"These areas affected by the floods are now offering a major series of permanent lakes, the region has completely changed and the people are living there, even in less than a year, a large number of pumps cannot eliminate water,\" he said. Expressing concerns, he said, \"There are risks of re -flooding in these areas till July 2023\". The Prime Minister said that Pakistan is facing the 'worst effects of climate change' and also highlighted issues regarding the hit view in 2022 in the country. \"It is a fact that in some of these areas, record heat has been heat, and so the weather has changed rapidly which is becoming normal,\" he said. The Prime Minister said that Pakistan has vigorously coated these issues and the government started $ 1.5 billion in an emergency basis. He said that Pakistan is grateful to the international community and friendly countries who helped to avoid the worst situation because more than two million houses, 14,000 kilometers of roads and 23,000 schools and medical centers were destroyed. He said that \"the aftermath of the crisis has been reviewed in partnership with the World Bank and the European Union and the flood damage was estimated at more than $ 30 billion, which is a tenth of Pakistan's Grass Domestic Product.\" \"This number is clarifying the situation, they require a reaction that strengthens the resources of a country,\" he said. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has seen scenes of incomprehensible destruction on the occasion of his visit to Sindh. He said that the catastrophe was far more than the floods in Pakistan in 2010, which was 'interpreted by the United Nations that it had experienced the worst crisis so far and that Pakistan could not deal with it alone'. Referring to the Environmental Conference, the Prime Minister said that he and the UN chief are hosting it in Geneva. \"We will be accompanied by global leaders, representatives of international diplomacy and welfare organizations and friends of Pakistan who will show cooperation and solidarity with the country where the crisis is not created,\" he said. He said that a roadmap has been developed in collaboration with the World Bank, the European Union, the Asian Development Bank and the United Nations, which will be offered for reconstruction and rehabilitation after the flood. The Prime Minister said, \"The first phase of the meeting is related to the challenge of at least $ 16.3 billion needed in 3 years for restoration and reconstruction. Half of funds will be received by Pakistan, but we will ask for constant cooperation with our partners to fill the gap.\" He said that the second part is in terms of Pakistan's vision to restore climate issues, which will require investment of $ 13.5 billion in 10 years. Shahbaz Sharif said that the Geneva Conference will begin a long and difficult journey which will be a hope for millions of people in trouble. \"I expect our meeting in Geneva will be a model of our partnerships and generosity and it will be a reason for all those who can face natural disasters in the future,\" he said."

         "State Bank of Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves reached the lowest level in 8 years with $ 5.576 billion during the week ended December 30, 2022. According to a report published in the Dawn newspaper, despite the rapid decline in the State Bank's reserves, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar is still optimistic to restore the situation based on the promise of financial support by the friendly countries, but no progress has been made in this regard. During the aforementioned week, the State Bank's foreign exchange reserves saw an expulsion of $ 24.5 million to pay external loans.  The pursuit of foreign loans is the most disturbing issue for the PML -N -led coalition government, which is facing a serious threat to default as many attempts to resume talks with the IMF have been fruitless. The falling reserves have already reduced the value of the local currency against the US dollar and other major currencies, and the State Bank's foreign exchange reserves were $ 16.6 billion in January 2022, which has now dropped $ 5.6 billion after a $ 11 billion fall. The lack of this massive foreign exchange reserves has left no room for the government to repay its foreign loans without borrowing from friendly countries. State Bank's reserve holdings are enough for only three weeks of imports. During the last week, the country's total foreign exchange reserves were $ 11.4 billion, including $ 5.8 billion from commercial banks. This situation is worrisome as foreign banks are receiving huge sums to open the letter of credit (LC), while local banks have been banned by the State Bank due to severe dollar shortages. The State Bank reported that the dollar closed at Rs 227.12 on Thursday, but the currency dealers in the interbank market reported a rate of Rs 228.10."

Addressing the inaugural ceremony of the NADRA office in Pansara, a suburb of Faisalabad, he further said that all subsidies provided to the people in different contexts are also eliminated in these pre -terms, if we do not, if we do not, it is possible to increase the rate of inflation. Federal Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah has said that the country is facing severe economic difficulties at the moment, these issues arise due to contracts with the former government's IMF, Fatina Khan first signed a contract with the IMF on strict terms. He said that on the other hand, Fatna Riot Khan is on the verge of defaulting the country through baseless propaganda. It is unfortunate that a man was imposed on the nation through political, saying that he did not leave the political opponent but he practically did nothing for the country and the nation. The Home Minister said that the people should not be upset. The Home Minister said that when Muhammad Nawaz Sharif was disqualified on August 28, 2017, the dollar was Rs 105, petrol at Rs 65 liters, electricity and gas prices were moderate and growth rate was 6.2 percent, which was to be 7 to 8 percent in the next two years, the country was growing and Pakistan was moving forward, but the country was imposed on the country for four years. He said that such a person was made such cases against the opponents that history was ashamed, but later none of these cases could be proved. The interior minister said that this Fatna Khan was sitting on the TV yesterday and saying that Rana Sanaullah committed 20 killings in Faisalabad, so if I had committed the murder, what was the need to make a false case of heroin against me, then the Punjab government would investigate these killings and punish me. He said that in the case in which Maryam Nawaz Sharif has been honored, five of the six charges were related to Mian Nawaz Sharif, who could not be proved because of being a liar. The Federal Home Minister said that the fate did not do anything other than abusing the opponents for three to four years, which led to both the country and the economy down and the people were worsened instead of prosperous. He said that this person taught the culture of glam glitch and dirt, obscenity and indecency to mislead the people, while his purpose is still to hand over the entire nation to mischief, because when someone abuses each other, there will be no peace. Rana Sanaullah said that if the fate again imposed on the country, it would destroy the nation from a major accident, so we have to minimize it with the power of voting and the political power of the democratic system which they will need to vote for the people. He said that no one was assassinated by Imran Khan, but it was a personal act of a man who was caught by his own workers and in every inquiry he confessed that since this person was being seduced by the nation and the youth, he personally attacked it, but now it was not a day after the attack, but it was not a matter of time. The problem is over and he has the opportunity to stay in the media through the same slander. Rana Sanaullah said that his audios have proved his nastyness. Imran Khan is now misleading the youth. This Fatna Khan introduced corrupt culture in our society. Referring to the inauguration of the NADRA office in Pansra, he said that he congratulates everyone on the inauguration of the NADRA office in Pansra, which has fulfilled a long -standing demand from the women area. He said that the National Institute is committed to providing facilities to NADRA citizens at their doorstep, which is why separate counters have been set up for women, elderly citizens and disabled people in the Nadra office. Rana Sanaullah said that he was given a grant of Rs 50 crore for the construction and development of his constituency by the federal government which he gave to both provincial members so that he could do development work in the constituency, but since the grant is very low, he will try to get more grants."

It is understood that the law and order situation in the country has worsened in the past few months, terrorist groups like the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan (TTP), militant group ISIS and Gul Bahadur groups are attacking nationwide. The banned TTP is theoretically linked to the Afghan Taliban, which launched more than one hundred terrorist operations across the country in a short period of time. Terror incidents in Bannu have increased the highest since the banned TTP's end on November 28, 2022.  On December 8 last year, a policeman was killed in a terrorist attack at a check post near Kangar Bridge in Bannu district.

Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif also addressed the ceremony in Hazara yesterday, saying that the IMF delegation will come to Pakistan in two to three days to review the new $ 7 billion loan expansion facility for Pakistan.

Despite the rapid decline in the State Bank's reserves, Federal Finance Minister Ishaq Dar is hopeful that the promises of friendly countries will get financial support and the situation will change, but no money has been given by the friendly countries. On the other hand, the State Bank's reserves have declined by another $ 24.5 million due to the payment of external loans during the week.  The issue of interest payment for the federal government is causing the worst problems and therefore default concerns are being expressed, while negotiations for the issuance of a new installment with the IMF are not yet proven. Due to the decline in national reserves, the value of the country's currency has also fallen compared to the dollar and other foreign currencies.

         "After the rise in wheat flour and poultry prices in the country, Ramadan is now expected to increase in ghee and oil prices and shortages. According to a report published in the Dawn newspaper, most domestic budgets are already being affected due to rising wheat flour and chicken prices and if immediate steps are not taken, the oil and ghee crisis may intensify in the future, especially in Ramadan. In this regard, the responsible constituencies responsible for producing oil, soybeans oil and sunflower oil are losing, due to the banks not opening a letter of credit and not issuing retiring documents for clearance of goods at the port, despite the fact that the state has been declared on December 27, 2022. Customs bonded warehouses have been banned from lifting 3 lakh 58 thousand tonnes of edible oil from the customs bonded warehouses due to the opening of the letter of credit and the rejection of retirement documents. The State Bank has been informed that commercial banks have informed importers and manufacturers that edible oil has been immediately removed from the list of necessary goods. As a result, delays will be fined due to negligence or lack of retirement of the letter of credit in support of a foreign supplier, while at the same time, the rupee is losing its value against the dollar, which is also increasing imports. Talking about this situation, Secretary General of the Pakistan Vinaspati Manufacture Association (PVMA), Omar Aslam Khan, pointed out that the price of oil oil has already increased from 13,000 per mobile to 14 thousand per mobile, which has increased the prices of Rs 26 per kilogram/liter of ghee and oil. Similarly, the clearance of 3 lakh 58 thousand raw materials is yet to be done, while one lakh 75 thousand tonnes of raw material is located on Karachi and Bin Qasim ports on 10 ships. He said that if the retirement of the letter of credit is delayed, the consumers will face up to 15 to 20 percent in the price of ghee and oil per kilogram/liter. Sean oil, sunflower and soybean oil take at least 60 days to reach Pakistan from abroad. He called on the concerned authorities to immediately resolve the issue from the third week of March in Ramadan and to avoid the oil crisis. He said that the demand for oil and ghee goods increases by 25 to 20 percent during Ramadan. Sheikh Abdul Razzaq, chairman of the Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturer Association, wrote to the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan Jamil Ahmed in a letter that 90 % of edible oil is imported in the country to meet the need for more than 4.55 million tonnes annually. \"Our current stock can only meet the demand for three to four weeks, so it is inevitable not to release the letter of credit and documents, and it is very important to give priority to the central bank's December 27, 2022,\" he said. He urged the head of the State Bank to instruct commercial banks to give priority to the letter of credit at the request of industries. He added that the industry is facing many different difficulties, despite the release of stocks from the Karachi Customs Bondware House, the industry is unable to lift them due to the refusal of banks to retire documents. The head of the PVMA said that the situation for several weeks has now begun to have a negative impact in the market. In progress, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Mohammad Tariq Yousuf expressed regret that the letter of credit was not opened despite the instructions of the State Bank. In his statement, he said that the bank was not opening the bank letter of credit for importing essential goods like raw materials, fruits, vegetables, pulses, medicines. He added that commercial imports are very important for the industry, especially exported industries, so it cannot be stopped at any cost. The head of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that a large number of container clearance at the port are awaiting clearance which is increasing the fines and in many cases the container fines have exceeded the cost of existing goods. He added that these containers are owned by the ship, which is very important to return as soon as possible but the delay in clearance in the container will affect Pakistan's role. He urged the government to issue immediate instructions to leave all these containers without a fine."

         "Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf (PTI) leader Fawad Chaudhry has claimed that a few military generals, including former Army Chief General (R) Qamar Javed Bajwa, played a role in ousting the PTI government. During the interview with the British news agency 'BBC' program hard talk, the former minister said that in 2018, the army did not help PTI to come to power, but PTI came to power after 22 years of struggle. He said, \"There was no doubt that a few military generals were involved in the conspiracy to oust our government. The former federal minister claimed that the establishment was controlling the PTI as well as coalition parties during the previous government. Responding to a question about the DGISI press conference, he said, \"The current military leadership has just taken office, we are hoping that the policy will change, but the former army chief's claim was not true that we had sought his help, we just asked him to be neutral.\" He rejected the impression of being anti -PTI army, saying, \"Everyone knows that PTI is not against anyone. Non -elected institutions like the judiciary and the army in Pakistan have used their powers beyond the constitution in the past.\" Asked about the evidence of Imran Khan's claims regarding the dismissal of the PTI government through a foreign conspiracy, Fawad Chaudhry said that \"the party leadership presented evidence about the involvement of the US in the elimination of the PTI government in important meetings but did not pay attention.\" However, he said, \"PTI does not want a strong tension with the US, no one should interfere in the issues of governance of Pakistan. In response to another question, he made it clear that Imran never called Osama bin Laden a 'martyr', during a speech, his tongue slipped, which was later explained. Regarding the security challenges, Fawad Chaudhry said that the PTI was constantly negotiating with the Afghan government in the previous regime and we were really close to the solution. However, he claimed that the present government ruined all these efforts because of the ignorance of Afghanistan's history and problems. Fawad Chaudhry said that the PTI could wait for the elections but the present government is not ready to hold elections because they know that people will oust them by voting. He said that elections are necessary for Pakistan, not for the PTI. We are demanding that elections be held as soon as possible so that a new responsible government can take care of economic affairs. He said that after Imran Khan's unconstitutional dismissal, Pakistan has become a major political crisis. Fawad Chaudhry claimed that Pakistan's reserves were $ 16 billion at the time of the motion against the former prime minister and now the reserves have come down to $ 6 billion. He said, \"The present government has no economic plan, terrorism has also re -engulfed the country. How can economic stability come to the country without political stability?\" Denying the impression that PTI's failed policies were to be dismissed, he said, \"When the PTI took power in 2018, the country was suffering from destruction, we fought against Corona, we created 55 million jobs and we improved the growth rate, all of them. \"As far as the economy was concerned, we were actually adopting a better strategy, but the current turmoil wrapped everything,\" he said. Fawad Chaudhry said that he had faced terrorism as well as blasphemy charges while Imran faced 28 false criminal cases. On the host's question, he termed the Election Commission's allegations against Imran in the Tosha house case as ridiculous, saying that the allegations are based on misconduct, hopefully the courts will provide justice in this regard."

         "Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf leader Shaukat Tareen says Finance Minister Ishaq Dar does not understand the economy and he is not eligible for that position. Reacting to Ishaq Dar's press conference on January 4, according to a report published in the Dawn newspaper, Shaukat Tareen said, \"Ishaq Dar's January 4 press conference is trying to divert the economic catastrophe from the PDM imposed by the PDM imposed on 20 million people. He claimed that the details mentioned in the PTI's white paper are based on the original data of the economic survey, the State Bank and the IMF reports. Shaukat Tareen added, \"Our real focus during the PTI government was on the problems and destruction of the previous governments. Despite the corona epidemic in the PTI government, the development of the economy with 6 percent growth for two consecutive years is proof of our outstanding performance. The PTI leader added that the PDM government has failed to formulate any policy to resolve the economic, state bank reserves, fears of default while paying international loans. Former Finance Minister Shaukat Tareen criticized that the Finance Minister failed to resolve the rising inflation issues, claiming that record inflation and unemployment caused the people to suffer due to the failed policies of the present government. Shaukat Tareen claimed that a total of 80,000 jobs were created during the PTI government against the present government. The former federal minister said that under the PDM government, the State Bank's reserves fell rapidly to $ 5 billion 80 million in December, which was enough to meet only one month's imports, no explanation of the restoration of the IMF program and financial support from the friendly countries. He asked how it is possible that the government has funds to run the federal cabinet consisting of 75 ministers but do not have the money to provide relief to the people? The PTI leader said that even former Finance Minister Muftiah Ismail and other members of the PML -N also appeared to criticize Ishaq Dar's policies, with record exports in the government of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, with large -scale manufacturing, the economy was growing at 6 % for the second consecutive year. He added that the economic situation in the PDM government has taken a serious shape and the State Bank has estimated due to tax measures and imported restrictions that GDP may be reduced by 2 % in the new year. Shaukat Tareen said that the former finance minister also blamed the government for the destruction of the economy, all industries from textile mills to automobile manufactures are closing and large -scale laborers are being fired. He said that the PDM government not only rejected the PTI's reforms, but also imposed further tax on taxpayers and put economic pressure on them. Talking about private sector loans, Shaukat Tareen said that during the PTI government, the loan for the private sector has increased by Rs 16 trillion. He said that the rate saw a sharp decline when the PDM government loaned loans from the private sector remained at Rs 260 billion during the July and December fiscal year 2023, which was Rs 600 billion during the same period of the last financial year. Shaukat Tareen said that the performance of these sectors during the current government in the current government compared to the current government in matters such as current account deficit, exports, foreign investment and power sectors was better."

According to the Prime Minister's Office, Cristalina Georgio expressed sympathy and concern over the human and material losses caused by the floods last year and reaffirmed its commitment to help Pakistan in difficult times. The Prime Minister invited the official to attend an international conference organized by Pakistan regarding climate change in Geneva, Krisalina Georgio thanked the Prime Minister and said that she would be able to attend the conference online as the IMF Board meeting was already scheduled for January 9 and 10. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif also appealed to the business community to support the government's recently announced energy protection plan to ensure the early closure of markets and restaurants, fair use of national resources and a reduction in import bills. The Prime Minister said at a function of Hazara Electric Company in Hazara area of ​​Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that it would reduce oil imports and dollar rates and later the money would be spent on the development of the country, including agriculture and medicines.

         "Former Home Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed has said that the Sharif brothers are meeting abroad to decide their political future instead of helping the flood victims. Addressing the rally participants in Lal Haveli, Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed said that the countdown against the federal government would start from January 9 and end in April. \"I am making my first speech in the New Year to Lal Haveli, when I see TV, opponents change the channel,\" he said. Sheikh Rasheed said that in the name of the population and the florist, the national treasury looted money in the name of disabled people in Sindh.  He said that the statements of the Foreign Minister and the Home Minister were putting oil on the burning. Sheikh Rasheed claimed that Imran Khan was being tried to kill through a slopeing, Imran Khan would dissolve the provincial assemblies otherwise he would instruct party members to resign from the assemblies. The former federal minister said that his party Awami Muslim League would come out with Imran Khan in the next elections. \"The rulers should bring their foreign assets back to Pakistan for national security, the current government has failed to deliver and made people's lives inaccessible,\" he said.  Sheikh Rasheed said that it has been difficult for citizens to buy food items, pay utility bills and spend money on their children's education, while the government is busy making money by raising flour, sugar and oil prices. Meanwhile, former Home Minister and Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf (PTI) activists and supporters also staged a rally against inflation. The participants of the rally marched from Lal Haveli to Fawara Chowk, led by Sheikh Rasheed and his nephew Sheikh Rashid Shafiq. Participants were carrying party flags and shouted slogans against the PDM government and in favor of Imran Khan."

         "### Key Findings\n\n**Food Availability and Access:**\n- Crop and food production in Chagai has been severely affected by torrential rains and flooding, leading to significant losses in wheat and vegetable crops.\n\n**Livelihoods and Economic Conditions:**\n- The economy in Chagai is affected by border closures, protests, and political instability. Many residents rely on cross-border trade with Iran and Afghanistan, which has been disrupted.\n- There is potential for economic growth through the Reko Diq mining project and proposed olive cultivation, though these are long-term prospects.\n\n**Coping Mechanisms:**\n- Prolonged strike actions indicate community responses to administrative restrictions and economic hardship.\n- Households are seen to resort to protests due to the enduring closures of border points affecting trade and access to resources.\n\n**Displacement and Migration:**\n- Afghan refugees are being repatriated and provided with basic facilities in Chagai, which involves housing, food, and medical aid.\n- The presence of unregistered Afghan refugees and violent incidents indicate underlying migration challenges.\n\n**Environmental and Climatic Events:**\n- Severe weather events, including storms and floods, have caused major destruction of housing, infrastructure, and crops, deeply impacting local livelihoods.\n- Relief efforts appear insufficient, with continuous rains predicted to compound existing damages.\n\n**Health and Nutrition:**\n- A polio outbreak in Chagai highlights health challenges with 43 cases reported nationwide, including in Chagai.\n- Malnutrition concerns are not explicitly detailed, but access to healthcare and impacts of environmental disasters likely exacerbate these issues.\n\n### Notable Quotes\n\n- \"The rain and flood victims have been shifted to safer places, while continuous rains also tripped several power feeders, which is facing severe problems for the citizens.\" (Article 17)\n- \"Deputy Commissioner ... said that the Afghan refugee camps should improve the environment of the forest camp.\" (Article 16)\n- \"The victims say the government's aid sent is equal to the camel's mouth. More assistance is needed.\" (Article 21)\n\nThese findings underline the complex interplay of environmental, economic, and administrative factors affecting food security and livelihoods in Chagai, valuable for informing IPC phase classification discussions.",

According to a report published in the Dawn newspaper, according to the project director of the olive cultivation development program, there is a huge potential for olive cultivation in Bhamba, Aminabad, Sendak, Chhatar, where thousands of hectares of land are available and there are suitable varieties of olive cultivation in these areas. Former Chairman Senate and Senator Sadiq Sanjrani met Federal Minister for Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain in Islamabad, which discussed the promotion of olive cultivation in Balochistan. He called for the establishment of 'Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC)' in Chaghi to promote agricultural production in Balochistan. During the meeting, issues related to the agricultural situation, improvement of agriculture and change were discussed in the province. Rana Tanveer Hussain highlighted the importance of agricultural change in a wide area of \\u200b\\u200b40,000 square kilometers of Balochistan and hoped that there were huge potential for the development of grain and horticulture crops in the area.  Pakistan has 82 million hectares of cultivated land, out of which 40 million hectares are in Balochistan. The federal government's olive development project on the basis of previous farming, land availability and other weather types have identified seven potential clusters in the country. These clusters were found in Balochistan's Barkhan, Musa Khel, Zhob Division, Khuzdar, Noshki, Wasak and Panjgur. Under the second phase of the olive cultivation program, commercial olive cultivation on 75,000 acres of land will be included in the priority identified clusters. The analysis of the olive value chain by the United Nations International Trade Center (ITC) pointed out that commercial cultivation of olive crop in Balochistan was ignored. This crop has become rapidly popular in recent times due to low water needs, drought endurance, and strong resistance to pests and diseases. In the northeastern and central parts of Balochistan, there is hardly any organic or non -organic fertilizer used in the entire districts of olive. In Balochistan, the Agriculture Department has arranged two, two for Khuzdar and Loralai to promote this new crop at a productive level, while recently arranged a small unit for Musa Khel to provide olive processing facilities to the farmers at their doorstep. The ITC report states that the amount of oil in Balochistan due to favorable climate is 18 to 22 percent, while the amount of oil in Potohar area of \\u200b\\u200bPunjab is 8 to 10 percent.\"}, {\"title\": \"In the Recodic Project, the non -Balochistan mafia has decided to push the Baloch population into backwardness.\", \"date\": \"2025-01-02\", \"location\": \"Chagai\", \"relevant_features\": \"corruption, looting, displacement, economic crisis\", \"content\": \"Chaghi (Urdu point newspaper - online - 02 January 2025) The press release of the National Party Chagai states that the non -Balochistan mafia has decided to push the Baloch population into the backdrop in all respects in this regard.

Among them are 5.9 billion tonnes of gold and silver at Ricodak in Chagai District, one of the largest reserves in the world. There may be mining for forty years. In the past, there were agreements to search for these reserves, then they were also littered, and in the end their cancellation is a tragedy in the history of the country. Some time ago, a foreign company agreed to sell 50 % of its shares with Barrack Gold, while the remaining 50 percent came to the federal and Balochistan section. To advance the work, the federal government has now approved Saudi Arabia to sell 15 percent of its share of Rs. According to a senior Petroleum Division official, Saudi Arabia will get 10 % of the project's shares in the first phase, for which it will pay $ 303 million (Rs 92 billion) to Pakistan. In the second phase, the sale of the remaining 5 % shares will provide $ 210 million (Rs 58 billion 44 crore) to Pakistan. The first installment payment is expected immediately after the transfer of the first 10 % shares. The agreement is being described as a reflection of a new era of cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has shown a keen interest in searching for the second mineral wealth in Balochistan, as well as mining for 40 years. In this largest province of Pakistan, about 40 most valuable underground minerals have been discovered so far, which can meet domestic needs for the next 50 to one hundred years, according to cautious estimates, including oil, gas, gold, copper, uranium, iron, coal, gastric, ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost, ghee, ghost, ghee, ghost, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gallon, gums Sulfur, and plutinum, etc. are also included. Recodic is expected to receive 10 billion kilograms of copper and 36 million grams of gold. According to official data, the country's economic growth rate was 0.92 percent in 2024. The mining growth rate was 4.6 %, which is very tragic. Paying full attention to Balochistan can change not only the destiny of this unlucky province but the entire country. With the help of China, the project of economic transit is being worked on. Similarly, the focus is needed to utilize other natural resources. Saudi Arabia is taking full advantage of the interest in investing in Rikodak and other mining resources. Not only the Ricardic project, but the long beach of Balochistan also has trillions of dollars of oil and gas. The need is to find an investor to utilize it.

The fencing in the border areas has caused many problems in some districts of Balochistan with the obstruction of the movement of people. Now people in these areas have been protesting the blockade for the past 282 days. Senior government sources confirmed in The News on Wednesday that the matter is very sensitive in the context of US sanctions imposed on Iran, so the government is looking for a solution to start a barter trade so as to avoid any violation of sanctions. Due to this situation, complex conditions were also created at the internal level as people in the area have been demanding protests and rehabilitation between the two countries for the past 282 days. In these 13 districts, 56 % of Balochistan province is settled. About ten thousand motor launches were used to bring oil from Iran. It is estimated that the smuggling of about one million liters of petroleum products is currently underway from Iran on a daily basis. Government and intelligence agencies knew that there were a network of 14,000 people nationwide who were allegedly involved in the transport and use of smuggled oil from Iran. Now the Minister of Commerce and other ministers, along with the Higher Authority Committee bureaucrats, are considering options to regularize the border trade without violating any provision of sanctions. Traders involved in this barter trade have suggested to the government that Rs 30 to Rs 50 per liter can be imposed. These traders have alleged that bribes of up to Rs 50 per liter have been received for the transport of petrol and diesel at the checkpoints in different parts of the country. If the government starts receiving levy up to Rs 50 per liter, then paying for them will not be a problem in the state exchequer.

The most terrorist attacks were reported after 2014 in the year 2024. The recent wave of militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan reminds us that terrorism is raising its head again. For a country that suffers from political instability, this is a state of a nightmare. Are we failing to fight terrorism? In the last 5 years, extremist attacks have increased significantly. Target killings, suicide attacks and attacks on security installations are taking place on a normal basis. Former tribal areas of Bajaur, North and South Waziristan have been most affected by the wave, while terrorists have also spread their activities in adjoining districts. Some southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are now practically controlled by miscreants. Most of these attacks have been claimed by banned organizations, which are now equipped with more modern weapons and are more organized than before. Over the past 5 years, more than 2,400 terrorist attacks have been carried out in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Law enforcement agencies were targeted. Provincial administration and growing unpopular federal forces failed to stop the militant attacks. According to the Pakistan Institute of Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), based in Islamabad, 1,627 security personnel were killed in militant attacks from January 2020 to November 2024. This number is very worrying and raises questions regarding our counter -terrorism strategy. Over the past two years, the most casualties have been reported in terrorist incidents. According to the same report, 508 security personnel were martyred in 645 terrorist attacks last year, where the attacks were clearly seen in 2024 and the number of them reached 856 a month before the end of the year, while 476 security personnel were martyred in these incidents. In many cases, the miscreants exchanged shootings with security forces. Such cowardly attacks show how strong the miscreants have become in the tragic areas of unrest. There are also instances in which terrorists have also taken hostage of security forces personnel. All this happened when security personnel claim success in counter -terrorism operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. The banned Tehreek -e -Taliban (TTP) is also spreading its activities in other districts, making it very likely that extremist attacks will stop. There are also a large number of terrorists in Central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The most troubled is the new alliance between 'Taliban' and sectarianism. In the recent sectarian violence in the former tribal areas of Kurram, several people have died, which has given militancy a deadly direction. The affected area has been closed for the past several weeks, while the administration has failed to reduce tensions in the region. Communal conflicts in Kurram and Orakzai districts are not a new issue, but the situation became more complicated when the Taliban took power in Afghanistan once again, which gave the TTP a chance to re -mobilize. Other external elements are also the cause of the situation. The tensions between the provincial government led by the federal government and the Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf (PTI) have also adversely affected law enforcement agencies in the province. It is perhaps the fact that the TTP's arrival in Afghanistan has strengthened the TTP to accelerate its activities in Pakistan. The so -called Islamic Emirate is providing safe havens to the TTP, while also providing shelter to other militant groups that are increasing the risks to Pakistan. But this is primarily due to the absence of a policy of anti -terrorism and anti -extremism in the country, which has given terrorist groups an opportunity for their operations. In 2021, Pakistan participated in the so -called peace talks with the TTP at the behest of the Afghan Taliban, which has proved to be a destructive mistake. During this process, Pakistan released a large number of TTP commanders, many of whom were ruthless killers. Thousands of armed miscreants were allowed to return to Pakistan in the talks by intelligence officials. TTP leaders remained in Afghanistan, but many of the banned outfit came to Pakistan to take action again. Negotiations failed after the banned TTP ended the ceasefire and resuming attacks on Pakistan's security forces. Interestingly, the talks began when Imran Khan's government was the last day in power, while the new PDM government continued to talk to the Taliban. But the security establishment is responsible for the terrorist challenges facing Pakistan and the increase. On the other hand, extremist attacks in Balochistan have also increased rapidly. However, the security challenges facing both the provinces are of different nature, but their combinations have complicated the threat of terrorism. Security personnel and installations are targeted by Baloch separatist groups. There have also been reports of any alliance between the TTP and Baloch militants, which has increased security concerns. In addition, the incidents of targeting Chinese citizens working on Pak-China economic transit in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan are also concerned. The attacks on Chinese citizens by terrorists have reflected the diverse agenda of militants operating in different parts of the country, which causes curiosity. The allegations against the involvement of external elements in the recent attacks will also be somehow authentic. But most importantly, Pakistan needs to review its anti -terrorism strategy and improve its home affairs. The real question is, do we have a long -term strategy to deal with the growing threat? Individual operations will do nothing. For this we need to do a comprehensive method. Unfortunately, the worsening situation of political stability in the country has made it more difficult to tackle the challenge of terrorism. The distribution country cannot cope with the serious danger.

According to the Dawn newspaper, political leaders also demanded the cancellation of land allotment to non -locals in the province. These demands were presented during a joint press conference on Monday. The joint press conference was attended by Maulana Hidayat -ur -Rehman Baloch, Provincial Amir of Jamaat -e -Islami, Rashid Khan Nasir of the Awami National Party, Yusuf Khan Kakar of the Pashtun National Awami Party, Ali Ahmed Lango of the National Party, Allama province of Hussein Jafar and Jamaat -e -Islami. Maulana Hidayat -ur -Rehman presented a 17 -point declaration at a multi -party conference in Quetta two weeks ago. It states that the main problem of Balochistan is the denial of the rights of the people over the ownership of the resources, with the unconstitutional and undemocratic measures of the powerful forces in the past and present, as well as the illegal occupation and exploitation of Balochistan's coastal belt and resources.  The statement called for a de -setting of non -elected representatives, calling for the announcement of the 'original elected public representatives' victory. The statement condemned the forced disappearances, extra -judicial killings and the kidnapping of political activists and youth, calling the actions a violation of basic human rights and freedom of expression. The statement called for the immediate release of all the missing persons and demanded the cancellation of the 26th constitutional amendment, which allowed 90 days extra -court detention. It also condemns the burning of the missing persons camps and the closure of all borders in Balochistan, including Chaman, Taftan, Gwadar, Panjgur and Mand, which has left more than 3 million people unemployed. The statement called for future decisions to be made in consultation with political parties and elected representatives to immediately reopen all borders and facilitate border trade. The statement also calls for steps to curb drug trafficking, which has led to millions of youths suffering from the problem and demanded a ban on drug cultivation. The multi -party conference statement urges the government to end military operations in Balochistan and take immediate steps to stop the growing drug trade in Quetta, Gwadar and other cities. On the occasion, cases filed against political leaders and workers, including Sardar Akhtar Mengal and Dawood Shah Kakar, and raids on religious seminaries under the guise of counter -terrorism were also condemned, which causes panic among the students and citizens. The statement further demanded that the illegal trailer mafia operating in coastal areas like Gwadar, Pasni, Giwani, and Mora and Gadani be controlled, as it was destroying the livelihood of local fishermen.\"}, {\"title\": \"EU condemns terrorist attacks in Balochistan\", \"date\": \"2024-08-27\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, terrorism\", \"content\": \"The European Union condemns terrorist attacks in Balochistan \\\"We condemn the abominable attacks of separatist groups in Balochistan, there is no place for terrorism and violence,\\\" said Nabila Masrai, a spokesman for the European Union's Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  \\\"Such actions are a threat to the foundations of democracy, our sympathy is with those affected by the terrorist attack,\\\" he said.

Once again, the ruling elite of the country has been reminded of the serious situation of Balochistan province. The reason for the serious situation is to kill the workers, passengers of Punjab on September 3, 2024, which is responsible for the members of the Balochistan Liberation Army. The tragedy has encouraged Akhtar Mengal to resign from parliament. Akhtarmangal is an experienced politician from Balochistan whose friend and enemy respects both, he has expressed disappointment and displeasure with the ruling elite in Islamabad, the current political crisis has long been overlooked by Balochistan, which has led to a long -awaited overlook. The car is a warning by a politician. In a detailed article written in 2013, the Baloch people mentioned the complaints from the government and mentioned the main reasons for the growing tension between the central government and Balochistan. And there were some requests for reducing it, re -presenting this article for readers' interest and information. Balochistan is currently on the brink of a time bomb since the partition of the subcontinent, Balochistan has been ignored publicly, economically and socially. Sadly, Pakistan has treated the province like its colony. However, with the development of technology and communication and global political changes, the Baloch is becoming more and more aware of their rights and they are busy seeking help from overseas to resolve their grievances, so their complaints should be heard carefully, before it is too late, the need for better and more difficult to resolve the issue of humanitarianism, and to resolve the issue of human rights. The rich and comfortable barracks living in their comfortable rooms will have to suffer, so it is important to remove the growing problems of the poor Balochs, which they have been in the hands of their chiefs and feudal lords and careless Pakistani rulers and their bureaucrats. For the restoration of law and order in the province, the people should be provided with all kinds of practical support to rid the clutches of their local masters, but unfortunately there has been no significant change in past conditions in the past decade, now the third generation of young people who have a better job of using their political education are more effective. Using, the campaigns of violent nationalists are financially supported by both the US and India's secret agencies- other Balochistan is of strategic importance, and due to the largest reserves of undeniable mineral resources, the eyes of the external and internal elements are focused on the long-awaited war of the war, and the long-standing power of Balochistan. In view of the current international political scenario, the importance of Balochistan increases. The US's seemingly defeated decision to leave Afghanistan and rule the Taliban as a rule over the country, according to some political analysts, had a deliberate tactic to deceive competitive powers, which showed less its interference in the region, and they secretly access the Gwadar port to the Himalayas, to reach the Himalayas, to the Himalayas, and to reach the Himachals. The government and the military are engaged in convincing and pressing, working on the KPK and Balochistan borders inside Afghanistan is an important part of the terrorist organization TLP and Balochistan Liberation Army attacks and encouraging US policy. In this, its cooperation with India should be kept away from the western borders and kept it away from the eastern borders and Kashmir and give India a justification to continue its own economic development so that it can be able to counter China. Therefore, the two countries are adding more fuel to the tumultuous and uncontrollable situation in Balochistan, in this context, the policy writers sitting in Islamabad and Rawalpindi depend on the Balochistan conflict architects. Stabilize. The reasons for the disappointment and dissatisfaction with the Balochistan government and the real and lasting solution to external interference in its internal affairs should be the top priority of the Government of Pakistan- before deciding the full use of force, study the situation in depth and sincerely. First, first to bring Balochistan equal to the rest of the provinces, education and infrastructure will have to be improved. Secondly, economic and social differences will have to be eliminated by the indiscriminate and unprecedented use of unbearable powers by the chiefs, nawabs, feudal lords and bureaucrats and strengthening the process of accountability. III will have to improve the revenue and profit from the local resources and to improve the quality of life. Fourth, more employment opportunities need to be created and locals should be given priority for training and recruitment. Five, in the province, the right -wing class should be encouraged to take part in the urban and political life so that they can realize their importance. Reforms in both the local and national government's electoral system should be performed priority so that young men and women, especially in rural areas, can be encouraged to play their part in running their local affairs and activating management. It would be funny and unintentional to follow the policy of using military force alone to counter the growing terrorist attacks for the province's government. This terrorist and extremists can be strengthened, the tactics of external and internal elements involved in other destructive activities can take a long time to restore peace in Balochistan by a credible, sustainable and attractive social reform, but it is a very sick economy of Balochistan to take on Balochistan and Balochistan. Want But if the rulers of Islamabad fail to make necessary reforms to prevent the worsening situation in this ignorant and deprived province, Akhtar Mengal's prediction could be true soon.\"}]",
         "Based on the information provided, several key factors suggest that Chagai is likely to face a food security situation categorized as IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) for the prediction period Nov-Mar 2024-2025:\n\n1. **Food Production and Availability:** Severe weather events, including torrential rains and floods, have significantly impacted local crop production, notably wheat and vegetables. This reduces food availability and affects food supply chains negatively.\n\n2. **Market and Economic Disruptions:** The article notes disruptions in cross-border trade due to border closures and political instability. These issues further exacerbate access to food and essential goods.\n\n3. **Livelihoods and Coping Mechanisms:** Economic difficulties are evident, with residents engaging in protests due to economic and administrative restrictions. Such activities indicate the use of crisis coping mechanisms by households.\n\n4. **Health and Nutrition:** The ongoing polio outbreak and inadequate health facilities can negatively impact nutrition and general health, compounding food insecurity issues.\n\n5. **Environmental and Infrastructure Damage:** Inadequate relief efforts in response to severe weather and the destruction of housing and infrastructure suggest struggling recovery efforts, which are likely insufficient to prevent food insecurity from escalating.\n\n6. **Weather Conditions:** Although there has been minimal precipitation and a stable temperature range from January to October 2024, past flood impacts and existing socio-economic challenges suggest lingering effects into 2024-2025, affecting food access and income sources.\n\nThe combination of these factors points towards significant challenges in meeting food needs without resorting to severe coping strategies, indicating IPC Phase 3 status.",

Even today, the Baluchi people marry each other in these areas of Oman and Pakistan and both Oman and Pakistan consider their home. After the discovery of oil, Oman proceeded to rapid development, but behind this, the late Sultan Qaboos bin Saeed's superior thinking and leadership skills is more involved. He put the desert of Oman in the ranks of the developed countries that today, after Kuwait, the world's second powerful currency is from Oman and this country is regarded as one of the clearest and most peaceful countries in the world. There are at least 4 million Pakistanis and are playing their role in the economic struggle and development of Oman and Pakistan. They send their loved ones a large number of money to Pakistan, according to a numerical review, Pakistanis are ranked first to Pakistanis, the second of the United States, the second of the United Kingdom, the third of the United Arab Emirates and the fifth Pakistanis in Oman. Which is enough to highlight the importance of Oman in Pakistani circles, which is also in dire need. In view of this importance, a large embassy in Pakistan has been established for many years, which has been doing its job in the rented building, though for many years the Omani government has gifted land to build the embassy to build its own building. Interestingly, the foundation stone on this land has been inaugurated three times, but the work of the building has not started after several years, but according to a report, there are some funds. A letter was also written by former Ambassador of Pakistan Ehsan Wagon to the then President of Pakistan, Mr. Arif Alawi, but no progress was made. The weather is changing in the empire of Oman, former Ambassador of Pakistan Dr Imran Ali Chaudhry has completed his three -year tenure in Oman, he will be remembered in several respects, including his public welfare work, besides commercial attache, Ishrat Bhatti and diplomatic staff. In Oman, where he gained most of his positive public reputation from his Liggs, he sometimes even focused on unnecessary criticism, but the most important thing he did was to ensure the safety of Pakistanis on the occasion of the terrorist incident \\\"tragedy Imam Bargah\\\". It was a announcement when Pakistanis were afraid that they would not be accused of terrorism. All Pakistanis breathed a sigh of relief. The video was also seen globally and the BBC and The Nation also released reports on the incident. Now, the new ambassador to Pakistan, Syed Dr Naveed Safdar Bukhari, who looks simple, laughing and academic and experienced diplomats, is meeting with his community, he is meeting people of every class, and he is very clear about Oman what he has to do at a diplomatic level. In one of our meetings, he said that he wanted to immediately do the two to the high -level diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Oman, highlighting the high level diplomatic relations at the highest level and highlighting the positive image of Pakistan in Oman and connecting the other community with each other where they could not end their differences. They have their own vision on which they will certainly make every effort to follow. Two to three meetings with Dr. Syed Naveed Safdar Bukhari have been held. Their diplomatic experience distinguishes them from others. We feel like they want to do a lot and the community supported them, so they will do many things between Oman and Pakistan, which still has a lot of scope. However, the biggest problem at the moment is the closure of a visa for the Pakistanis, in which they have no fault, but the process is under a policy of the government of Oman. It is also coming to hear that Pakistanis have been banned on a visa and visa visa days, which requires immediate opening from the dialogue and a statement has also been issued by Ambassador of Pakistan Naveed Safdar Bukhari on social media in which they are negotiating with the local government to resolve the issue. However, this will be the biggest challenge for him at the time he will also need the help of Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and the Government of Pakistan and it is being heard that Ishaq Dar is going to visit Oman very soon, which will be possible with the efforts of Ambassador of Pakistan Naveed Safdar Bukhari. Its first aim is to move the trade relations between Oman and Pakistan towards the next destination and eliminate visa closures for Pakistanis. Ambassador to Pakistan is looking forward to establishing its own building, establishment of Pakistan's own building, construction of new Pakistani school \\\"apple\\\", restoration of Pakistan Social Club merit and many major projects of public literature and culture and improvement in the high -level relations of Oman Pakistan. Hopefully, their national passion will easily cross every problem.\"}, {\"title\": \"Dear homeland, what to happen!\", \"date\": \"2025-02-21\", \"location\": \"Gwadar\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, politically engineered\", \"content\": \"The state of Pakistan has been overwhelmed on many fronts, \\\"political stability\\\". In the near future, stability is not in the near future. Litmus Test of Stability, based on a phrase, \\\"Will you be able to fulfill its term at a time? For 70 years, every government of the state, every system has been under these two questions. How many countries in the region where the question 'will the government fulfill the term? Will the system go? ' The Kingdom of God is surrounded by all sides. India has been busy with our enemy, for 77 years. From the very beginning, the United States has been deployed, \\\"Why are you a friend whose enemy is heaven\\\". Today, India and the United States are suffering from a strategic partner, both patriotism. In the Cold War for the first 4 decades, we as the Front State, the next 3 decades under the influence of US -based US orders, \\\"Either You're with us or Against us\\\", we accepted slavery. For the past ten years, the United States has used every tactic to keep China's influence in Russia's Pakistan, but to keep it altogether. For at least 70 years, the US has become a special soul for the state. For the past two decades, the \\\"US -India strategic alliance\\\" has shook Pakistan. The US interests that China and Russia should stay away from the Indian Ocean. Unfortunately! In this context, the sin of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran is their geography. Pakistan and Iran are self -sufficient in giving China and Russia access to the Indian Ocean. Destroying Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran is the link of this series. So Afghanistan has made a Dysfunction State, apparently a government, completely helpless and helpless at the US. The United States is paying $ 300 million every year to the Taliban government to monitor. Before the withdrawal of the United States, it is in the same way that ISIS's destination in Afghanistan is also in the same way. Revolution in recent Syria is a spectacle for the Taliban government. The US gesture eyebrows, ISIS \\\"will fall on the Taliban government. If Syria's organized army, air force, tanks, weapons shells have been killed for four days, how can the Taliban government stay for two days? The real and real Islamic system will be established. What has led to the US 5th and 7th flat (70 naval fleets in each flat), with a quarter of the nuclear weapons, from Bahrain to Japan, from Japan, and China. The United States is capable of shutting down oil supply at any time. Brisbane Tazkara, a time of the importance of the Gwadar port in the Arabian Sea is credible. China and Russia have access to hot water, Gwadar has to provide. The wars in Palestine, South China Sea, Ukraine, etc. do not indirectly threaten Pakistan, but indirectly will have a profound effect. Importantly, terrorism has intensified in Pakistan after the work has resumed on CPEC. Not far, \\\"India and the US alliance behind it is\\\" terrorism, \\\", C -Pack Dil Yazdan fork, in 2014, Nawaz Sharif has shook the government's sticks from 2014, all the efforts to destroy the pro -politics. Finally, Imran Khan's government, the first government order of Commerce Razzaq Dawood, was blown up, \\\"We are shutting down the pack immediately\\\". Today, Pakistan, except China, has been in danger all four sides that work on the CPEC project is underway. Another tragedy of the state, whenever the United States destined Pakistan, our own establishment became the backbone of the United States. From the murder of Liaquat Ali Khan to the ouster of Imran Khan (right or wrong), where speculations about US intervention are not over, there is a picture of the establishment. Muhammad Ali Bogra to Shahbaz Sharif is not a prime minister in the history of the state who has reached power without the help of the establishment. So much so that the domestic situation today is such a resolution that stability or stability is both comfortable for the enemy. Sadiq, I understand that the current leadership of the establishment is beyond the influence of US, but stability and improvement is not in their backs. From 2015, the columns repeated dozens of times that the Panacea C -Pack project to change the destiny of the destiny will reach the seventh heaven. Our dominance, opposition, institutions are all priorities and intentions, their first and final priority is to keep the political system under its control. Every man desires for political stability by keeping the sophisticated state under his control. There has always been a repetition that C -pack will be of utmost importance for China. The United States, on the other hand, will not allow any pack to become a pack. There is no doubt that the American Indian alliance behind the terrorism that is today is making China's access to Gwadar. Another comparison is our political stability, sustainable peace and prosperity in China's interest. While the interests of the United States are associated with instability, the law and order and economic tunes recently. The purpose of instability, terrorism and economic misery has been unusable for China. In fact, without the pursuit of political stability, Pakistan cannot serve China's share of China or keep a stable economy and peace. The solution is the same! I wish all political and religious parties, establishments, institutions would have made their first priority to Pakistan, backed their personal interests. Unless all the congregations are united and worried about the state, they do not take away the zeal of power, do not reject the accident like December 16, 1971.

Ghalib also said: Whether it is angry or calling you to die today, if you are dead, it will be a matter of anger, calling, indifferent, injustice all acceptable but someone is ours. Both Jaffa and Wafa are an integral part of love. People suffer inflation, unemployment, poverty, refugees, prisons. If they are believed that the people above are their own. They are trying to bring the economy to the track, bring back greatness. When the Creator God believes that 'Oli Alam' is one of us. We have chosen them. These decree are planning on their own. Be confident that all these policies are sincere. As a result, the flowers will surely open, the bows will explode, the bubbles will sing, the coals will tease. But when they are sounding from all sides that these rulers are for a few days, they are interested in washing their stains. Amendments to the Constitution so that all institutions are legally and in their fists. And the laws are changed to become the court of the rulers of all key positions. Everyone is praising each other. Forget that 24 million people are breathing their climate. The life of the majority is not going comfortably. There is no good news from any institution for them. The ruler does not think of his own, his statements are dishonest. The subordinate does not care about the ruler, they are dishonest.

But now since 1985, the mere qualifications and popularity have not been enough. Now 'acceptance' has prevailed over both of them. It now has a majority on one side. Whose income is decreasing. Because she produces more children too. There are eight to eleven to eleven children of ordinary domestic servants, street guards, clerks, losers. Their income is far down with a lot of necessary costs. The essential commodities are higher than their reach. The courts spend their ages to resolve their disputes. Police do not consider them humans. The media does not consider their problems. Many of their children die in the lap. The concept of child labor does not understand that the deprivation of society and the state should be shaken. That facility is not available. She considers the number of her children as her support. Therefore, it also resists the \\\"Polyulation Control\\\", knowing the state's oppression. Lack of good food causes illnesses even more. Free standard treatment facilities by the state are inadequate. Drug dealers take their pillows and go to the majority settlements, under the flyovers, the young people of the same majority in the deserts, the cemeteries, add to the smoke to counter the grief. If the majority gets the opportunity to celebrate its existence after a year, it is rejected from Form 47. All the hopes, aspirations, dreams of this large majority have been put into trash by a few hundred families. Big harder guards have been stood on these garbage. Who do not allow young people to take these dreams and aspirations. Disasters, disasters, climate change, infectious cods are all destiny of the majority. Anger, invitations also target the majority.

         "Based on the provided information, Gwadar is likely facing an IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) situation for the prediction period Nov-Mar, 2024-2025. The key factors contributing to this assessment include:\n\n- **Food Availability and Access**: The Lumpy Skin Disease affects livestock, and market supplies are disrupted due to security issues and protests, all compounded by inflation making basic goods unaffordable.\n- **Livelihoods**: Economic disruptions are significant with terrorist activities and restrictions on crucial border trade, affecting income sources. While there is some financial aid for fishermen, it may not be sufficient.\n- **Coping Mechanisms**: Community protests signal significant distress. The ongoing economic difficulties force households to likely employ crisis coping strategies.\n- **Environmental Conditions**: Severe drought and rising sea levels threaten water supply and agriculture. The persistent water scarcity further pressures food availability and livelihoods.\n- **Weather Data**: The recorded data indicates high temperatures, minimal precipitation, and no significant increase in soil moisture, supporting the ongoing drought conditions impacting agricultural productivity.\n\nThese factors suggest that Gwadar is experiencing acute food consumption gaps and households are likely employing negative coping mechanisms, consistent with IPC Phase 3 conditions.",

Is found.\"}, {\"title\": \"The style of governance crisis and solutions\", \"date\": \"2024-12-31\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, malnourished, food insecurity\", \"content\": \"Pakistan was the richest country in South Asia in the 1990s. Today we are one of the poorest countries in the region. In 1995, Pakistan was six degrees in the UN Human Development Index and 18 degrees ahead of Bangladesh. With regard to the same index, today we are 29 degrees behind India and have fallen back 32 degrees from Bangladesh. Has our style of governance really spoiled that it has stopped working at all? There are four major responsible in our provinces: health, education, police and a few other civilian responsibilities such as water supply, cleaning of the area and building roads and maintaining them. The people expect the government to properly provide these important services. Let's start talking to health. The mortality rate of newborn children in Pakistan is second in the world, with the situation better than Pakistan in all the other countries of Africa, besides Lesotho and South Sudan. 40 % of our children are left physically and mentally weak due to lack of proper diet. 17 % of our children and 42 % of women have anemia due to anemia, ie steel deficiency. In the field of education we should start with these two facts: 78 % of our ten years of children cannot read two sentences in any language, and 26 million children are out of school. The quality of education is that according to the AESR survey of 2023, only 45 % of the children studying in the fifth grade can solve the question of mathematics of the second grade and the rate in Sindh and Balochistan is less than 30 %. It is relatively easy to talk to the police. If a simple question is to be asked whether most Pakistani police are a blessing or bother? So we think readers are well aware of how useful this police service is in their lives. Finally, let's talk about urban services. In most parts of our largest city, the pipe does not get water and the situation is getting worse. Water is sold to people by tankers so that the mafia can make money. Every year, for several weeks, our second major city, Lahore, does not have such a happen in which humans can breathe. The garbage removal system in urban areas is very poor and except the privileged urban areas are not equal. It is common for sewerage drains to be open across Pakistan. In addition to motorways in Punjab, which is also taken care of by the federal government or some of the roads that are used by VIPs, the average road situation in Pakistan is very poor. So it is quite clear that the performance in these four important areas of our provinces is very poor. Remember that Pakistani taxpayers pay Rs 12,000 billion annually to the provinces for these \\\"services\\\" provided by the provinces. The average pays 50 thousand rupees to the Pakistani provincial governments annually. To meet the government's expenditure and other expenses, we have imposed the highest income and sales tax on our people. We pay 38.5 % on our salaried class (including teachers), 49.5 % of our businessmen (including doctors), and 59 % tax on companies (including exporters). And after paying income tax, the government's sales tax of almost everything we buy, including the milk and medical devices of children, makes it 18 % more expensive. The failure of the state does not mean that the federal government is running better in any respect. How well it works can be gauged from the fact that we provide the most expensive electricity and gas in not only our South Asian territory but also in the global revenue countries such as South Africa, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. Today, the total number of foreign airlines coming to Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad is only less than the foreign airlines arriving at Dhaka Airport. In 2022, our flagship PIA suffered a loss of Rs 88 billion and this year 4.5 million passengers traveled to PIA. This means that our taxpayers, ie, pay Rs 19,500 to the PIA for every passenger traveling on the PIA. The PIA deficit is similarly increasing. Our railways will work for less than 2.9 crore passengers this year but subsidy of Rs 109 billion will be given. That is, once again subsidy of Rs 3700 for each passenger's journey will pay us taxpayers per person. Our government companies will lose more than Rs 750 billion this year. Your hard work has been earned and the amount collected after paying taxes at the higher level will be met. Despite such a big and permanent loss, our government is unable to make any reforms. We have seen only our governments grow even greater and more indebted than ever. Our style of government has developed in a system that can build meetings, committees, SROs and ordinances, but no one can take concrete steps for the public. Ask yourself: What facilities are providing you with the federal or provincial governments today? If we adopt an individual freedom, social justice and small government -based model by eliminating this colonial, elite and the state system, there is no reason why we will back our South Asian neighbors in a few years. What steps do we need to take? Transfer education, water and sewerage to the district level, and move the roads, police and health to the division level. The federal government should transfer funds directly to divisions and districts. There should be no more than ten ministries at the provincial level and 15 ministries at the federal level. All government companies need to be privatized. Airports and railway stations should also be handed over to the private sector. Reduce government regulations and simplify the procedure. Reduce income and sales tax. Reduce electricity and gas prices. Make the rest of the public schools to run a board and tell parents how they are run. Make sure that all poor children get free food at school. And the best of the most poor children in the country's best private schools should be spent. We need to reduce the size of the government substantially. For example, if we reduce the expenditure of the Balochistan government from Rs 900 billion to half, we can give Rs 15,000 a month to each of the 25 lakh families in Balochistan. This will change the economic, educational and political landscape of the province and the insurgency there will collapse in a couple of years.\"}, {\"title\": \"The new dangerous wave of terror\", \"date\": \"2024-08-27\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, economic crisis, terrorism, disruption to farming\", \"content\": \"Homeland is currently undergoing the most difficult period of political instability, economic turmoil and natural trials. The tragic accidents of visitors and traveling pilgrims and traveling from Iran, and the tragic accidents of vehicles, mourned the mourning of the night and the attacks on the night of Balochistan. According to preliminary reports in the areas of Musa Khel, Qalat, Mastung and Bolan, more than three dozen human lives were shed. The largest and most tragic incident occurred in Raha Sham area of \\u200b\\u200bMusa Khel, where the national highway was blocked by the terrorists from Punjab and destroyed them from Punjab. It is reported from different areas of the area. The sacred elements also set fire to 10 buses, 6 trucks and 7 other vehicles. A bridge was blown up near Kolpur, which led to the attack on the railway traffic and a railway traffic. Six bodies have been found that have been the target of terrorism. One person was killed in a blast in Quetta. Security forces have taken immediate retaliation and have conducted 12 terrorists in hell and their operation is still underway. The terrorists have been acquainted with the power of Pakistan, which has the power of Pakistan, which has the power of Pakistan. Apart from a passenger buses and a Levies police station, a hotel, bridge, toll plaza and hospital were also attacked, which can be assessed by the intensity of their ulterior motives. All the attacks were carried out at a time when the security forces and their auxiliary law enforcement agencies are on the verge of imposing a nationwide country. It is no longer a secret that Pakistan is also helping the enemy forces. The real place of terrorists is in Afghanistan, where they take action in Pakistan. Of course, the local destructive elements should use all their thoughts for all their thoughts. To prevent negative activities, our energies should focus on utilizing it seriously. Traffic accidents have become the norm, the problem of street crime and public peace is also getting worse. In this, political confrontation is to provide its patriotic elements for its ambitious elements.\"}, {\"title\": \"One of the reasons for unrest in Balochistan is propaganda, Sarfraz Bugti\", \"date\": \"2024-11-18\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"terrorism\", \"content\": \"KARACHI (TV Report) Talking to host Saleem Safi in the Geo's program \\\"Jirga\\\", Chief Minister Balochistan, Mir Sarfrazbagti has said that even if a man is missing, he has no justification.

Terrorists have increased the capacity of the night. The Afghan National Army left joges. They are now available in the market. This is a temporary Rise. You will soon feel the difference. Security agencies are planning. The fighting people who are fighting and Baloch youth are fueling. Come on, as a nation, the most damage is causing violence. Soon this Rise will be formed.

How much Munirille whistle is like, the heart -filled car is like time. Next, he does not look back. It is like life, new passengers come, the old goes, it keeps moving. Solding the lives, dreams and history of travelers in their boxes. Every box like a story echoes, echoing on the rhythm of the bandages. A small world passes through the big world, but sometimes, this speed suddenly stops, the fire is wrapped up, and the screams of debris are hanging in the air of time. One such tragic incident took place on February 27, 2002, when the Sabarmati Express was set on fire near Godhra in Gujarat. Dozens of innocent lives were burned and the horrific incident sparked horrific riots in Gujarat in which thousands of Muslims were martyred. Thus a burning train has become a forerunner of hatred and bloodshed all over the region. The train is also a promise. Of the intercourse, links and an unborn journey between the past and the future. The Compromised Express was not just a train, but a critical moment of communication between the two nations. On the night of February 18, 2007, the bridge near Panipat turned into a pile of ash. Under a conspiracy, its boxes were set on fire, the doors were closed from the outside, and dozens of passengers were burned alive. The last tragic thing of this brutal incident is that the Indian courts released the criminals who had committed the brutality. The backdrop of the attack was linked to the Mumbai train bombings of July 11, 2006, killing 209 people and blamed on Pakistan. I started to miss terrorist incidents in India when there were 425 passengers aboard Jafar Express. India's involvement in terrorism in Balochistan is not a hidden thing. 193 people were killed in bomb blasts in passenger trains in Madrid. On July 7, 2005, a London underground train was targeted, killing 52 people. March 29, 2010 Kumasko train was attacked, 40 people were killed in the blasts. On March 1, 2014, 31 people were killed in a Chinese city. On April 3, 2017, the Metro train was exploded in St. Petersburg, killing 15 people. Train means a refuge in motion, a place where the tired passenger surrenders in front of the steel silence on the tracks, with the belief that the journey ends with a safe arrival. Mixes calves. Therefore, it can be understood that the attack on the train is attacked. There is action against the processing process. Of course, the government has killed 33 terrorists with a successful operation. About 300 passengers were released, but all the details of it could not reach the public yet. I think the fine detail of terrorist incidents should also be told to people so that they can know the horror of their enemies. They look at the horrific face of the enemy elements and support their forces wholeheartedly. In order to stop terrorism in Balochistan, the government will have to set up its writ at all costs. He has to strictly bring the terrorists to their end, but I think it is a matter of goodwill, with a lot of love in this war. Will be Sustainable and permanent peace is not possible only through military operations. It also needs a light of justice, equality and development. When poverty is eliminated, when good education will reach every doorstep, when the highways of employment are opened, the lamps of hope will be lit in the tight streets of hatred. Terrorism can be fought not only with weapons but with a fair distribution of love, dialogue and dialogue. Balochistan should be given the same honor, facilities and opportunities that have the right of any prosperous region, so that the darkness of deprivation can be avoided automatically and the land of extremism becomes barren. This war should be fought not only on the borders, but also in the minds, because when dreams are secure, there will be no weapons, books and tools will be held.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan's key of development of Pakistan\", \"date\": \"2025-03-16\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"terrorism, corruption, economic crisis, humanitarian situation, displaced\", \"content\": \"The tragedy of Jaffar Express has once again shaken the entire nation. This is not the first case, but a long series of series in which innocent Pakistanis have been brutally targeted. The tragedy of the Jaffar Express has made the whole country mournful. In this brutal operation, innocent civilians were targeted, which all Pakistanis, regardless of political, religious or linguistic commitment, are sad and sad. Every patriotic citizen is condemning the cowardly attack and raising the question when will this bloodshed stop? What are the motivations behind this wave of terrorism, and how is it possible to solve it? In the unrest here, where local factors are driven, the intervention of world powers and neighboring countries is also an open secret that is misleading innocent Balochs for their own interests. There is several evidence of Indian intelligence agency RAW in Balochistan. Some self -made 'Baloch leaders' who are abroad are constantly gaining Indian funding and support so that peace does not be established in the province. The purpose of Indian intervention is to keep Balochistan destabilized so as to damage Pakistan's development, especially mega projects like Gwadar Port. The infiltration of terrorists from across the border, smuggling of arms and illegal trade has made the province's law and order more complicated. The changing situation in Afghanistan has also paved the new avenues of terrorism in Balochistan, as different groups want to strengthen their grip here. One of the major reasons for the ongoing unrest in Balochistan is the deprivation of the people there. For decades, the people of the province have been complaining that other areas are benefiting from their resources, while Balochistan itself is deprived of basic facilities. Issues of education, health, employment and infrastructure have given rise to deprivation among the Baloch people, which is benefiting anti -Pakistan forces. In addition, the issue of disappearances in Balochistan is under discussion. The issue is also being used for propaganda under a specific statement, though the fact is that security forces work within the realm of law. It is imperative for peace in Balochistan to adopt modern security strategies in traditional ways. The use of modern technology has become inevitable in operations against terrorists. We need to improve our intelligence system. Steps can further improve the capabilities of security forces, such as modern drone technology, night vision arms, bulletproof vehicles and satellite surveillance. All government personnel should be ordered to remain armed at all times to prevent continuous attacks against security personnel and civilians by terrorists in the province. For lasting peace in Balochistan, there will be a leadership on which the people trust and who is sincere with the state. In the past, governments that were deprived of public support, which led to instability in the province. The Baloch people have to assure that Pakistan belongs to them, and all their legitimate demands will be fulfilled. At the political, social and economic level, the people of Balochistan need to be formulated an effective policy to include the mainstream. The growing political polarization in the country has given the enemy forces an opportunity to continue their ulterior activities. Harmony between all the provinces, including Balochistan, has to be promoted and eliminated the impression that one province has the privilege of another. To ensure a fair distribution of resources in Balochistan, locals should be included in Gwadar Port, Ricardak and other development projects so that they can feel part of this development. A fair distribution of resources among all the provinces, giving the real representatives of the people of Balochistan to lead the opportunity and adopting modern security measures is an urgent need of the hour. Tragedies like Jafar Express require that we revise our strategy against terrorism and formulate an integrated national policy. Security, politics and economy need to work on all three fronts for peace in Balochistan. Sustainable peace in Balochistan is possible not only with the use of force but also through political stability, economic development and providing social justice. The stability of Balochistan is essential not only for Balochistan, but for the whole of Pakistan. If we succeed in establishing peace in this province, it will not only guarantee the economic and political stability of the country but will also mix the ambitions of the enemy forces in the dust forever. Balochistan is the key to the development of Pakistan. If peace and stability is established in this province, it will be a positive development not only for Pakistan but the entire region. It is time for us to have the foundation of a future where every Baloch, every Pakistani feels itself safe, prosperous and equal rights. We have to understand that the dream of peace cannot be an embarrassment without solving the problems of the people of Balochistan seriously.\"}, {\"title\": \"No one could imagine that electricity would be cheaper in the country, Khawaja Asif\", \"date\": \"2025-04-06\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"terrorism, conflict\", \"content\": \"Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif has said that no one could think that electricity would be cheap in the country, it was said that the country would go bankrupt, Shahbaz Sharif made the impossible possible in a year.

According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, the Pakistan Metrological Department (PMD) National Drought Monitoring Center (NDMC) said in an advisory on Tuesday that there was no rain in the plains, which increased the drought situation. The PMD said the alert is a continuation of the drought advisory -1 issued on December 9. From September 1, 2024 to January 15, 2025, there were 40 % less than normal rainfall across Pakistan. In Sindh, rainfall was reduced by 52 %, 45 % in Balochistan and 42 % in Punjab. Due to low rains, drought -like conditions have arisen in different parts of the country, including areas depending on the rain. In Punjab, Potohar area Attock, Chakwal, Rawalpindi/Islamabad, Bhakkar, Leh, Multan, Rajanpur, Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Khushab, Mianwali and DG Khan were seen. There are similar conditions in Sindh, Ghotki, Jacobabad, Larkana, Shaheed Benazir Abad, Dadu, Padidan, Sukkur, Khairpur, Tharparkar, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin and Karachi. A similar situation is being seen in Balochistan, Kharan, Turbat, Kech, Panjgur, Awaran, Lasbela, Nakandi, Dalbandin and adjoining areas. The advisory states that the drought situation is likely to worsen further as there is no significant rainfall in the areas depending on the rainfall of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan. The PMD said the situation is unlikely to improve, as the second half of the season is expected to remain as dry as the first half. The prediction of temperatures can be supported to turn mild drought into a mild drought, especially in areas depending on the country's rainfall. The advisory states that NDMC is constantly monitoring the climate conditions, clear drought is also expected to emerge in the coming months in the light of low rainfall and rising temperatures. In the advisory, authorities have been urged to take advance steps in the drought -down areas. The PMD has also said that during January, February, March 2025, negative environmental indicators like El Nino Southern Oslan (ENSO) are expected to remain. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration, ENSO is a meteorological trend, which includes a change in water temperature in the Central and East Pacific, the temperature and cooling pattern known as the ENSO cycle affects rainfall in many parts of the world. The PMD said that the transfer of the natural phase of the Indian Ocean Depole (IOD) to the natural phase is also likely to continue during the season. According to the Meteorological Department, some more rainfall is expected in Central and South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, most parts of Punjab and adjoining areas of Azad Kashmir. Rain is expected in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Hazara, Gilgit -Baltistan, Sindh and East Balochistan, but western Balochistan are expected to have less rainfall during the season. The PMD said the second half of the season is expected to be relatively dry compared to the first half. The Meteorological Department said that more rainfall in the northern areas during the early part of the season could help to fill the water reservoirs and maintain proper water supply, but less than normal rainfall in southern Balochistan could put pressure on local water resources, which could affect irrigation and domestic water availability. The advisory states that the availability of water for irrigation in the north may be sufficient, but close monitoring of the level of water reservoir will be needed to ensure proper supply for the second half of the weather. The PMD warns that hot temperatures and less rainfall than usual during the second half of the weather could lead to the start of the pollen season in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Meanwhile, temperatures than usual can start heat pressure in weak populations, especially in the southern regions during March.\"}, {\"title\": \"The terrorist wearing a veil of extremism\", \"date\": \"2025-03-19\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, humanitarian situation, economic impoverishment\", \"content\": \"The case of Balochistan is now \\\"if, since, since it has gone beyond.\\\" Who raised weapons, why Punjab exploits or exploits, what is the disease of the Baloch chief, what is the development budget of Balochistan, what is the solution to the problem of the missing persons, the BLA statement is true or wrong, who has the right to Gwadar, the Khan of Balochistan is not involved in the Balochistan. These questions have been discussed before, it will continue to happen, but under the guise of such a debate, terrorists can no longer be exempted. This phrase should not be written in principle, because no terrorist in the world gets a moment's exemption, but it has to be written because there was a statement regarding the deprivation of Balochistan, and there was a great deal of knowledge in this statement, no one was aware of it or that it was a matter of fact. But now if anyone thinks that the issue can be resolved through negotiations with separatists, they can be declared by announcing a new economic package, or with the help of any other political scandal, the time has passed. There is no support for any armed struggle in the world in which the trains of 400 passengers should be considered as hypocritical and do not see the identity cards of the poor and the helpless people, call them Nelson Mandela. Ten years ago, when there was a period of terrorism in this country, it was not in the sense that we would be able to defeat this monster so quickly, I was not sure, but as Pakistan won the war of terror, it should be taught as a case study. In fact, one of our problems has also been that they are hesitant to praise us that there is no 'label' on us, perhaps the reason is that nowadays itself is very good. The existence of separatist armed organizations around the world is nothing new. Why go away, there is Sri Lanka in the armpit, where the Tamil Tigers launched a separation movement for many years aimed at establishing an independent state in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka called Tamil Elam. The Tamil rebels occupied the Sri Lankan city of Jaffna and had practically made it their capital, which means the Sri Lankan government's writ was not there. The Tamil Tigers fought armed for decades and took all violent ways, including suicide attacks, which were declared by several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union globally. Finally, in 2009, the Tamil rebels suffered a complete defeat by the Sri Lankan army, and thus their struggle failed. Sri Lanka can do this, so why not? There is no doubt that Balochistan has extreme poverty, the mineral resources of the province did not reach the people, gas was removed from the needle to the last district of Punjab, but the stoves of the Baloch houses remained cool and many of the kinds of things that have been a source of fact, if they have a true message. But this is one side of the picture; In another post, the nationalist leader who posted a letter of statement wrote that Gwadar was part of Balochistan from the first day, so no one should be confused that if Pakistan bought Gwadar from Oman, it is a part of Balochistan. Anjanab began in 1783 and told how Gwadar had gone to Oman from time to time due to the throne fighting, and the British did not even deal with the situation, after which Pakistan just withdrew it and nothing else. Dear Dear here, the history of the history was mixed. The first question is, why should the talk start from 1783, why not start thirteen billion years ago when the universe came from the Big Bang! And if it was to start from 1783, then Gwadar stayed with Oman for a hundred years. In that period, no Baloch leader tried to get this mother homeland by the force of a gun, and when he became Pakistan, no chief did not think that his land was resolved by the Prime Minister. The defendant is just that every Pakistani is with the Baloch nation in the deprivation of Balochistan, but that does not mean that the facts should be distorted and the questions regarding the geography of Balochistan should be asked which India does not even do. In Balochistan, the terrorists are spreading the same statement that has no historical certificate. And regardless of all this debate, the kind of brutal acts that these terrorists are conducting in Balochistan will also end the statement of oppression which led them to sympathy in the media. There will continue to be a scholarly debate on Balochistan, currently we have to set up a state writ on one of Balochistan, and its way is to fight this war of terror as we have fought in the past.

The presence of anti -state militancy in this province and India's intervention has made the situation more complicated. If you look at the history of terrorism and militancy in Balochistan, we see many factors associated with the intense feelings of the people here, social and economic difficulties and the geographical importance of Balochistan. The presence of armed groups in this area and their actions has become a major challenge for the government of Pakistan. Baloch separatist groups and other militant organizations not only attack security forces here but also target local citizens. There are several aspects of interference in Balochistan in India, which are being discussed at different levels. India, a regional rival, is among the terrorist operations in Balochistan. Indian intelligence agency RAW is providing funding and training to create instability in Balochistan. These organizations are provided financial and technical support so that they can promote terrorist acts in Pakistan. India's intervention in Balochistan is not only limited to secret activities but also at the diplomatic level. Indian authorities have tried to highlight the situation in Balochistan on various international forums so that Pakistan will face pressure internationally. India's announcement of Balochistan's independence support has also created further instability in the area. China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a major economic project that has been launched to promote economic cooperation between China and Pakistan. Under this project, various infrastructure projects, such as roads, ports and energy projects, are being constructed in Balochistan. With the completion of CPEC, Balochistan will become an important economic and commercial center. Under this project, the Gwadar port will be linked to the global trade routes, which can prove to be a serious blow to India's economic interests. India well understands that the success of the CPEC can affect its regional and economic position. That is why India has tried to thwart the project by supporting terrorist acts in Balochistan. Balochistan's C -Pack project is considered a major challenge in India's economic policies. India is trying to prevent the success of this economic project by creating chaos and instability in Balochistan. India's intervention in Balochistan has had many negative effects. Militancy and terrorist operations have worsened the local law and order situation in Balochistan. People are living in an atmosphere of panic, while the economy has also been severely affected. Terrorist incidents have also damaged local business and development projects. India's intervention in Balochistan has further tense relations between Pakistan and India. There was already tension between the two countries, and India's intervention in Balochistan has increased the tension. Internationally, India's intervention in Balochistan has affected Pakistan's reputation. Anti -state militancy and India's alleged intervention in Balochistan is a complex issue with many aspects. India's support for terrorist activities in Balochistan is part of its efforts to protect economic and geographical interests in the region. The success of the CPEC can affect India's trade interests, and that is why India is trying to destabilize Balochistan. It is important to understand that the military measures are not enough to improve the law and order situation in Balochistan, but the need for the root of the issue to reach the root of the issue and to prevent it on a global level. Pakistan should inform the international community about the seriousness of the Indian intervention and terrorism issue and reform its internal affairs so that lasting peace can be established in Balochistan.\"}, {\"title\": \"Solutions to the Grand Dialogue\", \"date\": \"2024-09-16\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, politically engineered, corruption, food insecurity\", \"content\": \"I wrote in my previous column that due to difficulties in external debt payments, the government, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China were trying to get $ 12 billion worth of Safe deposits for 3 years, as well as $ 4 billion worth of commercial loan from the Gulf banks, but the current loan was offered by Pakistan.

In the past, the National Assembly's Standing Committees for Finance, Commerce and Economic Affairs, which I am Member of Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb, Minister of Commerce Jam Kamal, Governor State Bank Jamil Ahmed, Chairman FBR, National Bank President Rahmatullah Hussaini, Finance and TDAP were discussed in detail. I can say that \\\"all is good in the domestic economy nor is everything bad.\\\" Many sectors of the domestic economy have improved, including inflation, current accounts and trade deficit reduction, remittances, foreign exchange reserves, revenue collection increases and stability in the country, while the value of the country is stable. Loans have increased which has reached 6600 billion. I am happy that the IPPs have finally come to the negotiating table with the government and have agreed to review the agreements in the interest of the country, which was very important, but PIA, steel mills, railways, loan and money -reducing debt, money, and debt rate of money. Unbearable increase in payments, corruption, bad governance and political instability are a serious obstacle to restoration of the domestic economy. In view of the increasing incidents of terrorism in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, we have to fight terrorism together with the Pak army. The solution to the problems is the only grand dialogue for which Speaker National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq has set up an 11 -member committee comprising all political parties in Parliament. I urge all political parties to start negotiations in view of the security and interests of the country so that the serious challenges facing the country can be overcome and political uncertainty and instability can be eliminated.\"}, {\"title\": \"Jaffar Express attack: Forces completed operation on the second day, passenger recovery, all terrorists killed\", \"date\": \"2025-03-12\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, terrorism, displaced, economic crisis\", \"content\": \"After the attack on Jaffar Express in Balochistan, the security forces operation on the second day ended, a large number of passengers were recovered while all the terrorists were killed.

Similarly, it is important for the continuation of this success to link the educational field with it and set goals in the education sector regularly set global and local needs and set goals on how much development of the educational sector, how much degree holders can be achieved after it can be achieved. So first of all, it is very important to examine the role of the universities, not only the government universities but also the private sector universities, to achieve this goal. It is very sad to see that despite the good number of universities in the private sector, there has been no significant research work from them, though they receive heavy fees, after which they have no excuse for not doing research work, but unfortunately there is no better idea of \\u200b\\u200bthis. While using their influence while using their influence, government universities are not allowing them to flourish, and one thing is clear that the government universities are fond of public attention, though government universities are more likely to provide more education than the poor and the poor are more likely than the universities of the private sector. This problem does not seem to be solving. Punjab University is not only Punjab but one of the ancient universities of the subcontinent. His past is very bright, but he has the same problem. If the current temporary Vice -Chancellor is intended to be maintained on these occasions, then they should be made permanent, but the path of the Ad Hawk policy must be abandoned. The problems of the universities cannot be improved due to the absence of more effective strategies than financial matters, otherwise they will not be corrected. Dr. Amjad Magsi, president of the Punjab University Academic Staff Union, has very useful and viable suggestions in this regard. During General Musharraf's time, he wrote a PhD dissertation on Nawaz Sharif's politics. When Dr. Amjad Magsi was writing a PhD dissertation on this topic, Prof. Dr. Musarrat Abid contacted me these days and told me that the PMLN's people who have been part of the Nawaz Sharif government in the past are also so afraid that Amjad Magsi does not want to talk to Magsi. He is also well aware of politics and educational strategies. If the Chief Minister meets them and takes suggestions for solving the problems of the University teachers and the university, then this problem can easily be saved. Similarly, Prof. Dr. Kaleemullah Barrich, President of the Federation of All Pakistan University Staff Association and Balochistan University Academic Staff Association, has long been very active for paying the salaries and pensioners of Balochistan University, and it is not possible to pay for the last four months. Professor Dr. Karimullah says exactly that if these people are not satisfied with economic affairs, then they can be expected to provide a higher level of education. They have gone a symbolic campaign to draw the attention of the authorities to these issues, and this year, they have also been set up in a camp to solve the problems of salaries and pensioners in front of the President of Balochistan University. In view of the sensitive situation of Balochistan, it should be a priority to solve this problem in the first time, but when such a priority will be and no one knows.\"}, {\"title\": \"Issue of Balochistan's seriousness and government negligence\", \"date\": \"2024-09-24\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, economic crisis, humanitarian situation, human rights abuses, displaced\", \"content\": \"Written by: Mohammed\\u2026 The recent resignation of Bradfor Balochistan National Party leader Akhtar Mengal's parliament has created further discipline in Pakistan's already turbulent politics. Once again, the ruling elite of the country has been reminded of the serious situation of Balochistan province. The reason for the serious situation is to kill the workers, passengers of Punjab on September 3, 2024, which is responsible for the members of the Balochistan Liberation Army. The tragedy has encouraged Akhtar Mengal to resign from parliament. Akhtarmangal is an experienced politician from Balochistan whose friend and enemy respects both, he has expressed disappointment and displeasure with the ruling elite in Islamabad, the current political crisis has long been overlooked by Balochistan, which has led to a long -awaited overlook. The car is a warning by a politician. In a detailed article written in 2013, the Baloch people mentioned the complaints from the government and mentioned the main reasons for the growing tension between the central government and Balochistan. And there were some requests for reducing it, re -presenting this article for readers' interest and information. Balochistan is currently on the brink of a time bomb since the partition of the subcontinent, Balochistan has been ignored publicly, economically and socially. Sadly, Pakistan has treated the province like its colony. However, with the development of technology and communication and global political changes, the Baloch is becoming more and more aware of their rights and they are busy seeking help from overseas to resolve their grievances, so their complaints should be heard carefully, before it is too late, the need for better and more difficult to resolve the issue of humanitarianism, and to resolve the issue of human rights. The rich and comfortable barracks living in their comfortable rooms will have to suffer, so it is important to remove the growing problems of the poor Balochs, which they have been in the hands of their chiefs and feudal lords and careless Pakistani rulers and their bureaucrats. For the restoration of law and order in the province, the people should be provided with all kinds of practical support to rid the clutches of their local masters, but unfortunately there has been no significant change in past conditions in the past decade, now the third generation of young people who have a better job of using their political education are more effective. Using, the campaigns of violent nationalists are financially supported by both the US and India's secret agencies- other Balochistan is of strategic importance, and due to the largest reserves of undeniable mineral resources, the eyes of the external and internal elements are focused on the long-awaited war of the war, and the long-standing power of Balochistan. In view of the current international political scenario, the importance of Balochistan increases. The US's seemingly defeated decision to leave Afghanistan and rule the Taliban as a rule over the country, according to some political analysts, had a deliberate tactic to deceive competitive powers, which showed less its interference in the region, and they secretly access the Gwadar port to the Himalayas, to reach the Himalayas, to the Himalayas, and to reach the Himachals. The government and the military are engaged in convincing and pressing, working on the KPK and Balochistan borders inside Afghanistan is an important part of the terrorist organization TLP and Balochistan Liberation Army attacks and encouraging US policy. In this, its cooperation with India should be kept away from the western borders and kept it away from the eastern borders and Kashmir and give India a justification to continue its own economic development so that it can be able to counter China. Therefore, the two countries are adding more fuel to the tumultuous and uncontrollable situation in Balochistan, in this context, the policy writers sitting in Islamabad and Rawalpindi depend on the Balochistan conflict architects. Stabilize. The reasons for the disappointment and dissatisfaction with the Balochistan government and the real and lasting solution to external interference in its internal affairs should be the top priority of the Government of Pakistan- before deciding the full use of force, study the situation in depth and sincerely. First, first to bring Balochistan equal to the rest of the provinces, education and infrastructure will have to be improved. Secondly, economic and social differences will have to be eliminated by the indiscriminate and unprecedented use of unbearable powers by the chiefs, nawabs, feudal lords and bureaucrats and strengthening the process of accountability. III will have to improve the revenue and profit from the local resources and to improve the quality of life. Fourth, more employment opportunities need to be created and locals should be given priority for training and recruitment. Five, in the province, the right -wing class should be encouraged to take part in the urban and political life so that they can realize their importance. Reforms in both the local and national government's electoral system should be performed priority so that young men and women, especially in rural areas, can be encouraged to play their part in running their local affairs and activating management. It would be funny and unintentional to follow the policy of using military force alone to counter the growing terrorist attacks for the province's government. This terrorist and extremists can be strengthened, the tactics of external and internal elements involved in other destructive activities can take a long time to restore peace in Balochistan by a credible, sustainable and attractive social reform, but it is a very sick economy of Balochistan to take on Balochistan and Balochistan.

The recent report by the Asian Development Bank describes remittances as the main pillar of the Pakistani economy, which can increase domestic productivity and growth rate. During the global epidemic of Kod 19, when exports were sure, remittances did not decrease but also increased. In the fiscal year 2020, domestic revenue was $ 21 billion, which was $ 2 billion less than a year ago, but this year, the remittances of Pakistanis across the country were $ 26 billion in the first year, with $ 64 billion in June, with $ 64 billion in June. Remittances $ 30 billion 30 million. That is, the two major resources of foreign exchange are almost equal. In this situation, when the country is in dire need of increasing foreign exchange reserves, remittances and revenues should begin the race for development of who moves forward in a couple of years the next year, it is important to pay special attention to increase exports and increase remittances. It is also important to provide legal and easy transmission facilities, where it is also important to help the workforce and help them get jobs. The government focuses on the export industry throughout the year, various facilities and incentives are trying to increase the volume, diplomatic sources are used and steps are taken to promote revenue from the government level. If the government focuses on increasing the expulsion of the power force, the doors of the world can open for Pakistani skilled. The Arab countries of the Gulf are important markets for our employment, and these countries are still at the forefront of Pakistani manpower remittances. There is a need to arrange for workforce and help them get jobs. At a time when the volume of internal and external national loans has increased extraordinarily and every year a large portion of domestic income is spent on the interest of these loans, the steps taken to increase national income should be the government's main priority. Otherwise, it is not possible to get out of the balance of payments and control the current account deficit. How many populations do our economic planners have to borrow a few billion dollars from global financial institutions? If a comprehensive system is established for the remittances of the Pakistanis, it is estimated that remittances may increase by more than $ 5 billion. This is the money that is our own, and above all, it is a steady income that will be earned every month.

India -pro -terrorists have attacked more than 5 places in one night and identifying passengers from Punjab, while a high -ranking terror in Pakistan is a high -level attack in Pakistan.

The use of forced disappearances and force has increased. The common educated Baloch youth has got the impression that parliamentary politics cannot solve the basic problems of the Balochs.

         "The information from the summary suggests significant stressors on food security in Jaffarabad, likely elevating the IPC phase to Crisis (Phase 3) for Nov-Mar, 2024-2025. Here's the justification based on the provided evidence:\n\n1. **Food Availability and Access**: Reports of drought conditions due to low rainfall have negatively impacted crop yields and water supply, essential for agriculture and domestic needs. Rising food prices due to market supply issues and inflation exacerbate access problems.\n\n2. **Livelihoods and Economic Conditions**: Economic constraints, including closures of cross-border trade and high tax rates, further stress income levels and employment opportunities, particularly affecting daily wage laborers.\n\n3. **Coping Mechanisms**: A significant reliance on remittances suggests households are employing negative coping strategies to maintain basic living standards, indicative of a crisis level of stress.\n\n4. **Environmental and Climatic Events**: Drought conditions combined with episodes of monsoon flooding and landslides hinder recovery and infrastructure stability, limiting mobility and access to resources.\n\n5. **Health and Nutrition**: Persistently high malnutrition rates and limited healthcare exacerbate vulnerability, suggesting severe impacts on well-being.\n\n6. **Weather Data**: From January to October 2024, weather data shows low rainfall and high temperatures leading up to the prediction period, with evidence of severe stress in agricultural and water resources sustainability.\n\nOverall, these factors align more closely with IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), characterized by significant food access issues, livelihood stress, and reliance on crisis-level coping mechanisms.",

Now they will not be able to tolerate the sand and will go crazy. They are surprised, worried about how they have changed. They were thinking that the government would give us a number and would say that now you are completely free to flourish in the inflation mill. Go and beg the world wherever you want to spread the swing from the lenders. There is no stopping on your own and your children's stomachs, hungry. Begging from Ado, begging for a badge, begging, begging, begging friends, begging for enemies, drinking, drinking, no restrictions on the people who are in the mill. You guys are completely free to eat and drink. There is no restriction on you guys. Go and beg around the world and live a life of honor. But all couldn't be. What happened then? The bowlers who were drunk in the inflation mill were a huge blow. We were surprised to see a twenty -five -page official advertising campaign in the newspapers. An advertising campaign was for billions of trillions of rupees. In the inflation mill, we wondered where the government came to the government of the government. Has the government Namdar started to sell Balochistan's gold mines and sell it? Some bowls thought, may the government's name came out? There are many passing farmers, but who are convinced that this time the eighteen Muslim countries of the world have sent all the money of zakat and aid to our government. We do not have the bowels confirm any amazing feat. We are surprised, we are worried about how the government Namdar has shown his achievements in a few months that the 75 -year -old country has changed. Instead of detecting hidden achievements, I left home to see the results of amazing achievements. After leaving the house, I was not alone in the crowd, all the bowlers left home to see the results of astonishing achievements. The bowlers were desperate to see the consequences of amazing achievements and to become a witness. There is no example in the history of the world in which a government has shown such things in a few months that the country has been completely replaced and in a few months he also saw. Born a few months ago, the little celebration is weighing on becoming the Prime Minister after becoming the Foreign Minister in a few months. You do not need to be surprised. Our history is filled with such nasal charisma. I remind you that our own girl was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace some time ago. He saved the world from the third horrific war, despite being a little sperm. The world will be quite then, in which the child has been flourishing in the stomach of our mother and has become the Foreign Minister before being born and then becoming the Prime Minister. You will know that we have an old tradition that children are nominated for national and provincial assemblies before being born. Apart from the nominees, no one can sit on these seats, anyone who tries to sit in specific seats will fall prey to the herds. I do not know that I am heard. Otherwise, in our democratic assemblies, the father, son, brother, sister, husband, wife, mother -in -law, father -in -law, sister -in -law appeared to be sitting together. In a few months, I came out of the house to see the achievements of the government nominee and to become a witness. It turned out that the onion was getting two and a half kilograms of Rs. Two and a half rupees. The potatoes did not trust my ears. The device in the ear was removed from the ear and then put it in the ear. But my surprise increased. The chicken was available at Rs. 10 kg. We are an agricultural country. The flour was available for one kilogram of one rupee and a five kilogram bag was available for four rupees. What I put in my hand, I knew the price, I returned to the past at the same pace, returning to the past. I was not sure that what I was listening was possible. Our government is nominated. The Champions Trophy was won.

Heavy force and other law enforcement personnel of the Levies force arrived on the spot and resisted the armed men, but the kidnappers managed to escape with miners in exchange for firing.

On Saturday, hundreds of coal mine workers held a sit -in to put pressure on the authorities to ensure the protection of miners in Balochistan. The sit -in was held at a time when miners were abducted in the Daki area and 12 people were killed after a Matheen gas explosion in Zardalo area of \\u200b\\u200bHarnai.

For these terrorists, words like brutality, brutality, animals are inadequate. What are these oppressors taking revenge on the innocent and the poor from the Punjabis who go to Balochistan for labor or those who are travelers. This will not happen if they want any hatred against ordinary Balochs in Punjab in response to their atrocities and the country will move towards unrest. Whether it is Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or any region of Sindh or Pakistan, it belongs to our Baloch brothers as it belongs to the people living in another region. We will not hate our Baloch brothers or any other innocent Pakistani because of the terror of Pakistani BLA and other terrorist organizations operating in Balochistan. They will not allow any conspiracy of these terrorists to succeed. All are condemning what happened in Balochistan and all are sad. On this occasion, Dr. Rang Baloch, who was fighting for the missing persons, would also give a condemnation statement, demanding that action be taken against those responsible for the recent incidents. It would have been good that the Baloch solidarity committee, which held a sit -in in different parts of Balochistan in favor of the missing persons in the past, would also make a condemnation statement. The majority of the Balochs living in Balochistan have peace, they are the lovers of Pakistan. The chiefs there, the Nawab there, the members of the National and Provincial Assembly and the members of the Senate, the politicians there should speak in one language against the atrocities of the BLA and other terrorist organizations. If they do not speak against the terrorists, they will not move forward to stop their oppression, then these tyrants will not leave anyone on the say, the enemies of Pakistan. Is it not true that these terrorists recently martyred a Baloch deputy commissioner, did not even target some Baloch and Pashtuns in recent terrorist incidents? Are the BLA and other terrorist organizations doing there and the purpose of preventing the development of Balochistan is in any favor for the people of Balochistan? These terrorists are also enemies of Baloch education and their health. These terrorists are also killing teachers who are working to educate Balochistan. They are also killing doctors, engineers. The enemy is using the terrorists against Pakistan. They are eliminating them from prosperity and development by selling hatred to the people of Balochistan, terrorizing them in their name. The people of Balochistan, the chiefs, nawabs and politicians, all will have to raise their voice for the sake of Pakistan, so that the terrorists in Balochistan do not get any shelter.

According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), based in Islamabad, has released the figures in its monthly security report for October 2024. The report said that most of the 48 attacks reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, where 35 and 9 incidents occurred, respectively. This trend indicates terrorists' strategy to destabilize areas where they can easily take action because of geographical or social and political factors. There were limited but important incidents of terrorism in Sindh and Punjab. There were 2,2 attacks in both provinces, which indicated the terrorists' attempt to increase their influence beyond their strong strings.  A clear example of this is a suicide attack on Chinese citizens in Karachi by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which is Pak. China reflects a deliberate strategy to weaken economic partnerships. Similarly, the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists are allegedly trying to expand their influence in Balochistan's Pakhtun Belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Punjab. On the other hand, a strong response by security forces has resulted in the death of 84 militants in 15 districts of all four provinces, which indicate the active anti -terrorism strategy. In October 2024, a total of 48 terrorist attacks were reported in the country, killing 100 people, while the number of attacks in September was 45, with 54 deaths, 52 security personnel, 36 civilians and 12 militants.

Political instability and terrorism are at the forefront of the economic problems facing Pakistan. China and other friendly countries of Pakistan have also expressed this. For political stability it is essential that the business state be fully operated in accordance with the constitution and law and all state institutions perform their duties within their own constitutional limits. To tackle the temptation of terrorism, which is behind the internal factors and foreign, national consensus can be achieved. Two provinces of the country are most affected by the recent terrorism. For decades of political unrest and deprivation in Balochistan, there has led to the sentiment of separatism and thus the anti -Pakistan external forces have opportunities to use angry Baloch youths for their ulterior motives, while terrorist incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are generally used by the Afghan government in Afghanistan. To destroy the fortress of terrorism, it is necessary to launch another vigorous and nationwide operation like the past. The Epox Committee's statement said that under the commitment stability, no one will be allowed to challenge the state writ without any exception, the legal shortcomings that are obstructed in terrorism cases will be removed, effective use of information technology to promote unanimous national statement. At the meeting, the Prime Minister rightly made it clear that the security issue is dangerous to leave the army only, a good economy cannot be imagined in the unstable state of terrorism, harmony between all elements of power is essential. The Prime Minister made it clear that the problem of terrorism in Pakistan is very complex, there is a deadly relationship between terrorism and crime, drugs, smuggling, extremism and religious hatred. He strongly pointed out the fact that stability and rule of law are essential for sustainable development in Pakistan. This position of the Prime Minister is certainly in line with the facts. The elimination of terrorism is also possible only by fulfilling the requirements of the constitution and the law. Without these requirements, the actions of the missing persons are very prominent, on the one hand promotes anti -country sentiments in the affected families and on the other hand leads to retreat in the courts.

Addressing the visit of Quetta, he said that he had gathered on the occasion today, on which the whole nation is desperate that three days ago, terrorists in Bolan took hostages hostage in which more than 400 Pakistanis were traveling. He said that the Pakistanis were martyred and they did not feel the sanctity of Ramadan, the children, the elders and the women did not feel, they were brutally expelled from the train, and sat in the field and such an incident may have never happened in the history of Pakistan. Shahbaz Sharif said that the soldiers were also present in the deserted passenger, who were going to celebrate Eid at their homes, there were several dimensions of the way the tactics adopted to deal with these terrorists. He said that one was to save the lives of Pakistanis and to eliminate the terrorists, there was suicide bombers surrounded by the suicide bombers. We should all thank Allah that in the leadership of General Asim Munir, the Corps commander was in full swing, and the people who were in full swing, Akhtar, Akhtar, Akhtar, Akhtar, Akhtar, Akhtar, Aujar, Akhtar, Aujar, Akhtar, Aujar, Akhtar, Aujar, Akhtar, Aujar.

The Prime Minister said that the joint scheme he made, as a result, 339 of our Pakistanis were released, and 33 terrorists were sent to hell, now 2, two -and -a -half hours have been held, after which we went to the hospital to lead the injured. Shahbaz Sharif said that the Zarar unit, which was made against terrorism, addressed the officers and men of it and thanked them all with deep heartfelt heartfelt, from the government of Pakistan and 24 million people, and their courage, young men and their courage. He said that I think that today we have saved the lives of these innocent Pakistanis from these ruthless beasts, but God cannot afford any other accident. For this we have to contribute to all of us, Balochistan's government, Balochistan and Balochistan, Balochistan and Balochistan. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said that the Chief Minister will fully praise the performance of the government of Balochistan, the development and prosperity of Balochistan unless the rest of the provinces will be supported, I want to say that it will not be the development of Pakistan, there will be no prosperity of Pakistan. He said that unless terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan is completely eliminated, peace cannot be established in Pakistan. Shahbaz Sharif said that terrorism was eliminated in 2018 and the lives of 80,000 Pakistanis had to be sacrificed, the economy suffered a devastating loss of $ 30 billion and Nawaz Sharif was the prime minister at that time. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said why did the defector raise his head again?  His head was crushed, this is the question that has been raised several times, without going to a point scoring, if I say it is not wrong to say that those who are not tired of connecting and telling the Taliban's relationship with the Taliban, they have left thousands of Taliban again. He said that even the abusive characters were left out, at which time the army and officers of Pakistan are making sacrifices day and night in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, and the officer is protecting millions of children from being orphaned by orphans. Shahbaz Sharif said, \\\"I think there can be no greater sacrifice for the nation. We will not promote it, we will be responsible in the world and in the Hereafter. The Prime Minister said that the conversation that has happened now, the conversation on it cannot be brought to the language, and in our eastern part, our country, which has always been enmity with Pakistan, how did they eat Pakistanis living within the country, the way they are poisoned by Pakistan. He said that the intellect is stunned that it has come into the country, against Pakistan and the people and against the hostility against the army, the immense kindness of Almighty Allah has handled Pakistan's economy in a year, it has been exposed. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said that the place where we have arrived today, on the one hand, terrorism should be made and on the other hand, they should be made fun of and out of Pakistan and they should be ridiculed. He said that there could be no other crime against Pakistan, who invited the Taliban to Pakistan and said that they had cut off the chains of slavery and we kept 4 million Afghans here, they took care of them, they own millions of rupees today. Shahbaz Sharif said that after that, such enemies rose from inside and poison against Pakistan, poisoning against the army of Pakistan, they are employed day and night to protect the country. The Prime Minister further said that for 30, 40 years, I have been aware that the objective conditions of the country are such that politicians and this institution have to go to the country, it cannot be given a license to anyone to fly our young borders and fly to the enemy and fell in love with Allah. He said that these sacrifices would not go unnoticed, with which the development and prosperity of Pakistan is connected. If there is no peace then there will be no development and prosperity. Shahbaz Sharif said that Balochistan was lagging behind in the race for development, I acknowledge it, what are its motivations, we will not talk about it, we will talk about it but one thing I want to say was that 2010 was the NFC award, if Punjab did not recognize 100 % of the demands of Balochistan, it would not have agreed on the NFC awards. He said that since then, Punjab has been paying Rs 11 billion every year till date. I am not only happy as the Prime Minister, I am satisfied that we have done a despicable service to Balochistan. The same method has given one percent to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa before one percent partition in the same NFC award. Shahbaz Sharif said, \\\"If we do not eliminate the terror of terrorism, then the dust in my mouth can be a threat to the existence of Pakistan. If we do not wipe out the terrorists, the journey of dust, peace development and prosperity in my mouth will be broken immediately.\\\" The Prime Minister said that in Balochistan, Levies cost Rs 80 billion annually, they were trained, how much did they have weapons and other equipment? How much is intelligence, if we apply 80 billion rupees in modern equipment, weapons, artificial intelligence, stand a new force, then the map will change, such a large area of \\u200b\\u200bBalochistan and only 33,000 Levies personnel, who do not have equipment. He said that I was not accusing anyone, how many CTD did he make, Rs 600 billion, which went to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa? How many did they make Safe City, how many new forces did they stand? Shahbaz Sharif said that even today, we should take the nails of consciousness, what has happened, now we have to move forward, the way is to sit on the political leadership of the whole of Pakistan and those who love Pakistan, who also pray day and night for the prosperity and development of Pakistan, and even day and night. \\\"We will sit down and talk about what challenges are, the biggest challenge in my view is that we should have fully consensus, which is unfortunately lacking,\\\" he said. The Prime Minister said that I want to say to the whole nation that as many resources they want, I will provide them with them, I will also ask the province, we have to raise this fleet together. Shahbaz Sharif added that the incident that happened yesterday is a stain in the name of Baloch culture, and of course the terrorists who are the group will take every tactic, which will create a division among the people of Pakistan. He said that if something more is needed today, he will continue to do our own politics of national solidarity and national unity, but on the one issue that we have to be a meeting with the advice of the country from the khuj and this conquest and from this terrorism.\"}, {\"title\": \"Heavy rains in Balochistan have killed 21 people from July 1st\", \"date\": \"2024-08-20\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"floods, humanitarian situation, infrastructure damage, failed crops, cattle death\", \"content\": \"At least 21 people have been killed and 12 have been injured in the incidents of heavy rains in Balochistan province since July.

It was the worst bloodshed day in the history of Balochistan, killing several people, including security personnel. Balochistan's banned separatist group claimed responsibility for the attacks. On the one hand, where these violent attacks identified the capabilities of major operations by the separatists, on the other hand, they also raise questions about the state's failure to tackle the serious security challenges spread from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan. Both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have become a battleground by militants challenging the state's writ. On the one hand, security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are dealing with groups that want to enforce Taliban principles, while on the other hand, separatist groups in Balochistan are spreading their violent acts across the province. The recent wave of violent attacks has uncovered the state's weakness and failure to deal with the situation. The number of personnel killed by security forces showed how serious the situation had become. It is clear that the Baloch separatist terrorists are now so organized and they have so much support that they are doing such successful acts. It is no surprise that all these attacks took place in a region that has been the focus of political dissatisfaction for a long time. Earlier, for two decades, there have been low intensity attacks in the province from time to time, but now it is turning into a uprising due to increasing distrust of the locals. Recent violent acts were carried out at a time when public demonstrations in southern Balochistan have passed a few weeks. It was not only targeted terrorist attacks but also clashes with the security forces of the miscreants and the main highway connected to the province with other provinces of the country was also blocked. In unverified footage, we saw Turbat, the second largest city in the province, patrolling the streets. Government personnel were also targeted. The situation in the affected areas has completely out of hand while the administration has failed to handle the situation. The most worrying incident was to take passengers from buses and kill passengers on the main highway connecting Balochistan. This is not the first of this kind but it was a very disgusting event. Militants are targeting a large number of non -local people, most of whom belong to the working class. Such attacks have given separatist militancy a horrific direction. There is no opinion that no state will tolerate such violent attacks and those who challenge the state's writ. There is no doubt that the state has the right to use force to tackle this kind of terrorism. But at the same time, it is also important that we also consider the reasons for the political anxiety found in the province as to why the rebellion is increasing. Despite the use of force, the state has failed to suppress the growing uprising in the province. In fact, the local population of democratic and economic rights has reinforced rebel thinking. The growing incidence of force and disappearance in suppressing the protests has incited the fire of anger among the local population, especially the youth, and thus the number of devout people recruited into separatist groups has increased. What happened this week cannot be seen separately from all these angles. The responsibility of these tragic events also lies on the state, which also failed to hear the right demands of the people. The recent terrorist attacks took place on the anniversary of Nawab Akbar Bugti, who has been a former governor and chief minister of Balochistan, while he was also a very important and influential tribal leader. He was killed in a military operation on August 26, 2006. His death led to the third (largest) wave of rebellion in Balochistan. Unlike the last two waves, the focus of these rebel operations is not the region where tribal elders are dominated. Most leaders of the separatist groups belong to the educated background, unlike the middle class and tribal leaders. Recently, Tariq Khosa recently wrote about how the state atrocities defied Bolan Medical College Gold Medalist Dr Allah Nazar. Baloch Liberation Front leader Allah Nazar was abducted by intelligence agencies in 2005. His brother was killed in illegal custody. The stories of other devout people are no different. The endless series of forced disappearances and tortured bodies have attracted many people belonging to the affected families to militancy. Even peaceful protesters against the excesses of the state were declared a traitor. This is a poor way to handle security issues, which is the most important reason behind the current tense situation in the province. I remember that I was part of a media briefing that was given by a senior security officer in Quetta in January 2017. In this briefing, he described 'sub -nationalism' as the biggest problem. According to him, the most important task for security agencies is to make such people sincere to Pakistan, nationalists for Pakistan. When I asked the question why being a Baloch nationalist is wrong and what is about being a Pakistani, I was not answered in this regard. Such colonial thinking is also an important reason that Baloch nationalist leaders decided to participate in mainstream politics. All efforts were made to keep nationalist leaders out of power. The way the political parties were formed and they were given power in the province made fun of the democratic process. The February 8 elections are probably the worst example of how the system was scattered to form a government in the province. But this government, which has a controversial reputation, has been challenged by the power of the people and we have seen this in the recent protests and marches in Gwadar and Turbat. These protesters are not separatists or terrorists, but the state still tried to put them off the wall through their actions. No country can overcome terrorism by defrauding its population. The fact cannot be ruled out that these separatists have the patronage of external elements on which they are able to attack. But external forces also benefit only when the situation in the region is already in turmoil.

Despite being rich in natural resources, the region has long been suffering from unrest, insurgency and separatist movements. External factors have played an important role in this situation in Balochistan, of which India's intervention is the most prominent. The history of relations between Pakistan and India has always been tense and India's allegations of destabilizing Balochistan are part of these tensions. Pakistan believes that India is providing assistance to separatist movements in Balochistan to destabilize this important area of \\u200b\\u200bPakistan. The arrest of Indian spy Kulbhushan Yadav in 2016 is the biggest evidence of this claim. Yadav acknowledged that he was an Indian intelligence agency \\\"RAW\\\" officer and had been involved in terrorism planning in Balochistan and Karachi. This confession raised many questions internationally despite India's refusal. Yadav's statement is a clear example of India's alleged interference in Balochistan, which proves that India is disrupting Pakistan's internal affairs. The insurgency in Balochistan began immediately after independence, when some Baloch chiefs demanded a separate state. Over time, these movements intensified in different periods, and they also included an element of external intervention. In the 1970s, India was accused of providing weapons and financial support to Baloch rebels. At that time, India, along with Iraq, tried to weaken the influence of Iran and Pakistan in Balochistan. In the present era, there have been several evidence of the support of the Baloch separatists by the Indian government, including financial support and training. Balochistan is an important part of the C -Pack project, and Gwadar port is the center of the project. India is giving unrest in Balochistan to thwart the project so that economic partnerships between Pakistan and China are affected. In 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned Balochistan in his address on Independence Day, which was open interference in Pakistan's internal affairs. This statement exposes India's ambitions globally and shows that it wants to use the Balochistan issue for political gain. Baloch separatist organizations, such as the Baloch Liberation Army, are seeking help from Indian intelligence agencies. According to various reports, Baloch leaders were given asylum in India and they were provided diplomatic and medical facilities. The purpose of these activities is to weaken Pakistan internally and jeopardize its security. In addition, India is using various platforms to support Baloch separatists internationally. Pakistan has taken various steps to counter India's activities. The government presented evidence of India's intervention in Balochistan on the UN and other international forums. In addition, Pakistan has launched development projects in the province to solve the problems of the people and keep them away from separatist movements. Under the C -Pack project, development work is being done in the field of infrastructure, education and health sector in Balochistan, but these projects are facing challenges due to Indian intervention. India's intervention in Balochistan is dangerous not only for Pakistan but for the entire region. This is further straining Pak -India relations and is damaging peace and stability in the region. The international community should take notice of these activities of India and help Pakistan tackle the issue. Pakistan too will have to strengthen its internal policies and resolve the problems of the people of Balochistan on a priority basis so that they stay away from separatist movements. India's intervention in Balochistan is a serious problem which is a threat to not only Pakistan but to the peace of the entire region. To resolve this issue, it is necessary that Pakistan be stable internally and the international community should take effective steps to prevent India's activities. Without solving the problems of the people of Balochistan, it would not be possible to eliminate this insurgency. Pakistan has taken several steps to strengthen its internal security, including development projects in Balochistan, policies for the welfare of the people and raising their voice against India's intervention internationally. However, India's continued interference and the global community's silence are making the issue even more complicated. It is important that the international community take India's intervention seriously and work with Pakistan for stability in the region.\"}, {\"title\": \"Para Chinar Blood\", \"date\": \"2024-08-10\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, politically engineered, humanitarian situation, displaced, economic crisis\", \"content\": \"Written by: Syed Iqbal Haider\\u2026 Frankfurtapara Chinar is the area of \\u200b\\u200bPakistan where the Pakistanis are as patriotic as Pakistanis based in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad.

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi announced the withdrawal of Afghan refugees at a meeting with a UN delegation, according to the Dawn newspaper Carcort. Pakistan launched a deportation campaign last year following the increasing incidents of suicide attacks, where the federal government believed that the attacks were carried out by Afghan citizens, Islamabad also accused Afghan citizens of smuggling, militant violence and other crimes. Receiving a UN delegation at the Interior Ministry, Mohsin Naqvi emphasized the role of the United Nations and the international community in restoring the withdrawal of Afghan refugees. The interior minister said that terrorism is a global problem and Pakistan has been the most affected, while Mohsin Naqvi also highlighted irreparable sacrifices, including the lives of Pakistani security forces, police and the people against terrorism.  Mohsin Naqvi also apprised the UN delegation about the banned Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan (TTP) about terrorist operations in the country, with UN delegation included UN Resident Co -ordinator Mohammed Yahya, Feddy L. Miyashi, DSRSG, Special Assistant to Afghanistan. The interior minister said that the banned TTP is using Afghan soil to attack Pakistan, which should be stopped. He said that Pakistan wants peace and stability in Afghanistan and is ready for all possible cooperation in this regard, Pakistan has been hosting Afghan refugees for centuries, adding that the process of evacuation of illegal foreigners has begun. The Interior Ministry has assured the UN delegation not to take any action against foreigners living legally. UN special representatives also condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Balochistan. Officials said Afghan citizens, who were issued Afghan Citizens Cards (ACC), would be sent back to the second phase of the deportation campaign. According to the UNHCR's UN Refugee Agency, Pakistan has 21.8 million documentary Afghan refugees, including 13 million refugees, who have the Proof of Registration (POR) according to the 07-2006 census, while additional 80,000 refugees were issued under ACC Campaign (ACC). Since the occupation of the Afghan Taliban government in August 2021, a large number of Afghan citizens have turned to Pakistan, according to officials, the number was between 6 million and 8 million, with some having accurate travel documents.

One of these policies is Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister, Mr. Ali Amin Gandapur's efforts to directly negotiate with the Afghan Taliban. This step can not only exceed the constitutional boundaries but also pose a threat to Pakistan's security and international relations. Under the constitution of Pakistan, only the federal government has the right to make decisions on international affairs and foreign policy, no province has the right to take any steps internationally. The question arises as to why Chief Minister Gundapur felt the need to hold direct talks with the Afghan Taliban? Was the federal government aware of this process? Was this step in accordance with the principles of Pakistan's foreign policy? These questions have to be answered not only to the PTI, but the people of the country must also be aware of the facts behind these measures. The closeness between the leadership of PTI and the Taliban is no longer a hidden thing. On various occasions, the PTI government has taken a soft approach to the Taliban, which is not only harming Pakistan's internal security but is also damaging the country's reputation internationally. The presence of the Taliban in Pakistan and the leadership of the Tehreek -e -Insaf's leadership can further increase the dangers of terrorism, especially in provinces like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan where terrorist groups are already active. There are historical links between the Afghan Taliban and the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and these links can strengthen the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan. The negotiations with the Afghan Taliban can also be encouraging for the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the people and security forces facing terrorism will get a message that the government is having a gentle attitude with the Taliban, which can further enhance the operations of these groups. In these provinces, not only can the law and order situation be worse, but the prospects for development projects and investment can be eliminated, as in such a situation, investors and development agencies are frightened. Another result of PTI's negotiation policy with the Afghan Taliban may also be that the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is more active in Balochistan. Balochistan is already suffering from terrorism and separatism, and any relations with the Afghan Taliban can worsen the situation there. With the support of the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan, the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan can strengthen its roots in Balochistan, which is a strong concern for the situation in the province. The PTI leadership should also understand that negotiating with the Afghan Taliban can affect domestic politics. This policy can be severely criticized by other political parties and public circles in Pakistan. The question may arise in the minds of the people why negotiations are being held with an organization that targeted thousands of innocent people and promoted terrorism in the country? Pakistan has fought a long and tough war against terrorism, in which thousands of soldiers and civilians have been martyred and are still doing. The Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan can be encouraged by this policy, and their activities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan may increase further. Globally, Pakistan may face criticism, and can damage the country's reputation. Therefore, the PTI leadership should review its policies, and take a strong stance on terrorism so that peace and stability can be established in the country. The country currently needs a strong strategy against national solidarity and terrorism. The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan are already suffering from terrorism, and they need a leadership that can ensure their safety and development. The PTI government has to consider its actions, and understand that international relations and foreign policy are the scope of the federal government, and the provincial governments should refrain from interfering in these matters.\"}, {\"title\": \"'Taliban and sectarian alliance': Are we losing the war on terror?\", \"date\": \"2024-12-18\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"terrorism, conflict, internal strife, politically engineered\", \"content\": \"A decade has passed since the Peshawar Army Public School's terrorist attack. About 150 people, including students and school staff, were killed in this tragic accident in December 2014. This is a dark chapter of Pakistan's war on terror. After that we reiterated that this way would not happen again. Nevertheless, 10 years later, terrorist organizations responsible for the attack are active in spreading insecurity in the country. The most terrorist attacks were reported after 2014 in the year 2024. The recent wave of militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan reminds us that terrorism is raising its head again. For a country that suffers from political instability, this is a state of a nightmare. Are we failing to fight terrorism? In the last 5 years, extremist attacks have increased significantly. Target killings, suicide attacks and attacks on security installations are taking place on a normal basis. Former tribal areas of Bajaur, North and South Waziristan have been most affected by the wave, while terrorists have also spread their activities in adjoining districts. Some southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are now practically controlled by miscreants. Most of these attacks have been claimed by banned organizations, which are now equipped with more modern weapons and are more organized than before. Over the past 5 years, more than 2,400 terrorist attacks have been carried out in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Law enforcement agencies were targeted. Provincial administration and growing unpopular federal forces failed to stop the militant attacks. According to the Pakistan Institute of Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), based in Islamabad, 1,627 security personnel were killed in militant attacks from January 2020 to November 2024. This number is very worrying and raises questions regarding our counter -terrorism strategy. Over the past two years, the most casualties have been reported in terrorist incidents. According to the same report, 508 security personnel were martyred in 645 terrorist attacks last year, where the attacks were clearly seen in 2024 and the number of them reached 856 a month before the end of the year, while 476 security personnel were martyred in these incidents. In many cases, the miscreants exchanged shootings with security forces. Such cowardly attacks show how strong the miscreants have become in the tragic areas of unrest. There are also instances in which terrorists have also taken hostage of security forces personnel. All this happened when security personnel claim success in counter -terrorism operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. The banned Tehreek -e -Taliban (TTP) is also spreading its activities in other districts, making it very likely that extremist attacks will stop. There are also a large number of terrorists in Central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The most troubled is the new alliance between 'Taliban' and sectarianism. In the recent sectarian violence in the former tribal areas of Kurram, several people have died, which has given militancy a deadly direction. The affected area has been closed for the past several weeks, while the administration has failed to reduce tensions in the region. Communal conflicts in Kurram and Orakzai districts are not a new issue, but the situation became more complicated when the Taliban took power in Afghanistan once again, which gave the TTP a chance to re -mobilize. Other external elements are also the cause of the situation. The tensions between the provincial government led by the federal government and the Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf (PTI) have also adversely affected law enforcement agencies in the province. It is perhaps the fact that the TTP's arrival in Afghanistan has strengthened the TTP to accelerate its activities in Pakistan. The so -called Islamic Emirate is providing safe havens to the TTP, while also providing shelter to other militant groups that are increasing the risks to Pakistan. But this is primarily due to the absence of a policy of anti -terrorism and anti -extremism in the country, which has given terrorist groups an opportunity for their operations. In 2021, Pakistan participated in the so -called peace talks with the TTP at the behest of the Afghan Taliban, which has proved to be a destructive mistake. During this process, Pakistan released a large number of TTP commanders, many of whom were ruthless killers. Thousands of armed miscreants were allowed to return to Pakistan in the talks by intelligence officials. TTP leaders remained in Afghanistan, but many of the banned outfit came to Pakistan to take action again. Negotiations failed after the banned TTP ended the ceasefire and resuming attacks on Pakistan's security forces. Interestingly, the talks began when Imran Khan's government was the last day in power, while the new PDM government continued to talk to the Taliban. But the security establishment is responsible for the terrorist challenges facing Pakistan and the increase. On the other hand, extremist attacks in Balochistan have also increased rapidly. However, the security challenges facing both the provinces are of different nature, but their combinations have complicated the threat of terrorism. Security personnel and installations are targeted by Baloch separatist groups. There have also been reports of any alliance between the TTP and Baloch militants, which has increased security concerns. In addition, the incidents of targeting Chinese citizens working on Pak-China economic transit in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan are also concerned. The attacks on Chinese citizens by terrorists have reflected the diverse agenda of militants operating in different parts of the country, which causes curiosity. The allegations against the involvement of external elements in the recent attacks will also be somehow authentic. But most importantly, Pakistan needs to review its anti -terrorism strategy and improve its home affairs. The real question is, do we have a long -term strategy to deal with the growing threat? Individual operations will do nothing. For this we need to do a comprehensive method. Unfortunately, the worsening situation of political stability in the country has made it more difficult to tackle the challenge of terrorism. The distribution country cannot cope with the serious danger.

There is no attention to the power of the sectors. The point is that our rulers and their families are treated abroad and children are also studying there, but 95 % of the people living in Pakistan are living at the mercy of the situation.

The construction of the Gwadar port and the C -Pack projects has begun this economic development. It is clear to all that many terrorist organizations, including Indian intelligence agency RAW, are active in Balochistan. Balochistan's security is the top priority of the Pak Army and security forces are constantly engaged in operations. In the latest operation, 27 terrorists have been sent to hell in Kachhi district and several of their hideouts, including weapons, ammunition and explosives, have been destroyed. The killed terrorists were extremely wanted by security forces as well as in several terrorist acts against innocent civilians and law enforcement agencies. A spy was also killed on the Pak -Afghan border that smuggled weapons and ammunition to terrorists. Indian spy Kulbhu Shin was also arrested in Balochistan. The Pakistan Army Department of Public Relations has said that security forces, along with the nation, are determined to thwart every attempt to sabotage peace and development in Balochistan. President Asif Zardari and Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif have paid tribute to the security forces on the successful operation in the turtle. Our moment is that the United States and its allies left Afghanistan by negotiating with the Afghan Taliban, but we permanently put us in the fire of terrorism. As a result, the establishment of peace on our land has become a madman and our real enemy India has a rare opportunity to fulfill the goals of weakening our security. All that is happening in Balochistan is the link in the same series.\"}, {\"title\": \"Solar Energy: a revolutionary step\", \"date\": \"2024-12-13\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, rising inflation, food insecurity, corruption\", \"content\": \"Today, a person can hold a mobile hand and say. \\\"The world is dead .... It is a night and day ahead.\\\" Given the same spectacle, it was found that due to the rise in inflation, the Bank of Canada had reduced interest rates to four percent to three percent. Surprisingly, the reason for the rise in inflation in Pakistan is interest rate, which has been reduced by two and a half percent to 15 percent. Then it was learned that the interest rate was gradually brought down from 22 %. Wow failure - where did we come. Interest rates are reduced to reduce the cost of loans. It is easy to pay for people to take more loans. Investment increases, business has improved. Economic activities increase, low rates encourage people to borrow, but where three to four percent interest and fifteen percent, they have also been drawn from twenty -two. An interesting explanation is that this rate is not for big investors, not just for us. If anyone has to borrow forty fifty crores, interest rates can be reduced to five to seven percent. This rate will be fixed between banks and investors. That is, it is based on the system that the person who has to borrow this 4 million loans continues to pay interest all his life and who has to borrow 30 million. There is no problem in giving him interest. It is written in our fate of the weak and the most powerful to the weak. I asked the scholar of the world what about interest rates in your developed countries and interest rates in third world countries. So he said, \\\"I also consider religiously one percent interest to be forbidden, but from a point of view of humanitarianism, I think there is no interest. Bank costs are raised to deal with so many transactions. The real interest is what is practiced in countries like ours. \\\" \\\"The banks of the Jews, the Jews, lend only one percent of interest to every Jewish person,\\\" he said. The interest rate on most of the loans that Pakistan has borrowed from the IMF is two or three percent. Sweden's interest rate is zero percent. That is not, the interest rate in Japan and Brunei is zero -ten percent, meaning that it is not equal. Denmark is zero sixty percent, Switzerland is 75 percent, with three percent in Norway and Malaysia, about three and a half percent in China and South Korea and Singapore. The European Union is four percent. In Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom, it lives between five and a half percent. India's interest rate is six and a half percent. Countries where interest rates are close to Pakistan or more include Uganda, Hungary, Nigeria, Turkey, Iran, Egypt, etc. Some countries also have Islamic banking, including some countries in the UK, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Turkey, Indonesia, Qatar, Sudan and Nigeria. That is, interest is not taken or given. Models based on the joint distribution of profit and loss are used, but the profit that these banks give is almost only according to the interest rates of these countries. So far, no Islamic bank has announced a loss in its joint business. Swallow arises as to how the interest in Pakistan will be reduced, though government measures are not improving the economic situation. Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb has also said that the economy is moving in the right direction. Interest has declined, foreign exchange reserves have increased, but poor people are still in severe poverty crisis. According to the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, the poverty rate has increased from 38.6 percent to 39.5 percent. The level of unemployment is at a dangerous threshold. In Balochistan, 70 %, 48 % in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 45 % in Sindh, but the situation in Punjab is a bit better. The World Bank has expressed concern that the poverty rate in Pakistan will remain at 40 % by 2026. In January this year, the World Bank's Country Director Naji Bin Hussein wrote that seven percent of children die before five years. 78 % of the age of ten years of age is not able to read appropriate writing for their age. More than 200 million schools do not go. If Pakistan brings basic reforms to its economic program this year, it is expected that 2,000 forty -seven, or one hundred years after the establishment, will be included in the middle -income countries. This year's end is a few days left. The question arises that the government has taken any revolutionary steps for economic improvement. Let's see what can happen next year. Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz thinks that if solar energy is delivered to every house, steps can be taken to the economic revolution. They have gone to China in this regard, of course this idea is not bad, but those who have set up an oil -generating factories. Will they let that happen? The clutches of the capitalist system are very strong.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan: deteriorating conditions\", \"date\": \"2024-08-31\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, disruption to farming, humanitarian situation, lack of cultivation, restricted relief flights, mass hunger, food insecurity\", \"content\": \"We became light by writing about the worsening conditions of Balochistan. In gestures, cans and open words, do not question the patriotism of ordinary Baloch. Look at your poor to see what the real problems are and try to solve them thoughtfully. Baloch is very skeptical of the federal government. He is not in the federal and federal security agencies, not Punjab, today. In the war of power in Balochistan, the common Baloch has been badly falling. The problem begins with the imbalance of the vote bank between Baloch and Pashtuns and the blame is targeted by the ruling Punjabis in the federal government. When the Pashtuns are being politically strengthened instead of giving importance to the Balochs, obviously the Afghans are also associated with the Pashtuns who are affecting the Baloch vote bank by obtaining Pakistani identity and identity cards in the form of refugees. A long time ago, seven -day stay from Turbat to Quetta, personal observations during the road travel, the views of local Balochs and political and social figures were published in the same columns that it was revealed that the Zia era was against the Afghan jihad, which was against the Afghan jihad. At that time, the situation was slightly better than today but the storm was marking in the silent sea that Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan, was clearly divided into Baloch and Pashtun populations. The Baloch Pashtun could not live in the population and the Pashtuns were not ready to live with the Baloch. The Punjabis were afraid of the Balochs, which is why the Pashtun populations were forced to consider themselves more secure. Since the federal powerful institutions have the control of most of the people of Pakistan, the basic justification of hatred is made and it is a matter of fact that today Punjabi workers, skilled and traders are targeting BLA terrorists. The second most important reason for Balochistan's poor conditions is economic exploitation. All the projects, including the power, the power, the sandak and the mining, which we call the gold bird in them, rather than the interests of Balochistan, were rich by the local Baloch chiefs, politicians, but they did not spend a lot of money on the need for education and development of Balochistan. This has deepened the impression of deprivation and exploitation, due to lack of ordinary Baloch economic opportunities, Iranian petrol, diesel and other items have begun to rely on smuggling, now the feeling of being in strong hands in the guise of preventing smuggling is further increasing. Baloch youth, students and students are more conscious and talented than Punjabi, Sindhi youth. They want their name to be bright worldwide. But the Baloch sons and daughters were suspected that the only purpose to deprive them of the Internet is that the world could not see their faces. Now their identity has become something else. In Turbat, Gwadar, wherever the youths were talked about, their first suspicion was why they were being cut off from the world. Why is the federation afraid of them? It was a matter of time. Today, in a period of about four to five years, everything went out. No one has done anything to bring Baloch youth into the national mainstream. We celebrated the Baloch Culture Day and the Sindhi hat on the day of Ajark. A few dozen Baloch youths visit inter -provincial visits and keep in mind that they will go away. In Balochistan, our activities regarding health are confined to free medical camps rather than developing infrastructure. Hospitals were constructed at some places organized by the Pakistan Army but the civil role of the Balochistan government is nowhere to be seen. Even in Turbat, the situation was not under the control of the institutions. The local administration was afraid of the terrorists. The BLA terrorists were hiding in long mountain ranges, the general impression was that even the bird could not kill. The BLA terrorists used to get off the mountains at any time, turning to the cities, \\\"friendly fire\\\" and disappeared back into the mountains. They also had contact with the youth of the local population. Despite the mark, no one wondered how to control them. The strategy that you are happy with your home, we have failed. You have to think beyond that. Now the media of surrendering to some anonymous fray will not work. The martyrdom of 54 people, including the Pak army personnel, Punjabis, is testifying that the BLA terrorists have created a war situation by taking the form of a trusted force. Their operations would not be possible without a shadow of the neighborhood, distant countries. Just think that one day before August 26, Modi's plane passed away from Ukraine and passed the shadow of dishonesty in the atmosphere of Pakistan via Afghanistan. The next day, fire and blood holi were played in Balochistan. Is this just a coincidence, not at all? India has just suffered a wound in Bangladesh. Who is behind the bloodshed in Balochistan? There is silence on all sides, ah!

From the establishment of Pakistan, our economy is operating on debt and aid. To date, the state has not been on the ruling of the state. The IMF has given the country about two dozen packages in 75 years and sets the budget. Similarly, most infrastructure projects include the World Bank's consultations and loans. If today this country has reached the point where the construction is dead and the economy is ruined, then the responsibility of the people is not bad. We are also failing because we have never been able to get out of external pressure. New agreements will have to be made with Malaysia and Indonesia, the time has come for the government and economists to develop a strategy to bring Pakistan out of the clutches of the IMF and other financial institutions, the strict terms of the new debt from the IMF will increase the rise of a new debt and increase the debt. The burden of debt can be a threat to Pakistan's security, Pakistan has suffered a loss of Rs 1.5 trillion in the fight against terrorism, sacrificed millions of lives, many hundred people are still living a victim of terrorism in this war.

These questions have been discussed before, it will continue to happen, but under the guise of such a debate, terrorists can no longer be exempted. This phrase should not be written in principle, because no terrorist in the world gets a moment's exemption, but it has to be written because there was a statement regarding the deprivation of Balochistan, and there was a great deal of knowledge in this statement, no one was aware of it or that it was a matter of fact. But now if anyone thinks that the issue can be resolved through negotiations with separatists, they can be declared by announcing a new economic package, or with the help of any other political scandal, the time has passed. There is no support for any armed struggle in the world in which the trains of 400 passengers should be considered as hypocritical and do not see the identity cards of the poor and the helpless people, call them Nelson Mandela. Ten years ago, when there was a period of terrorism in this country, it was not in the sense that we would be able to defeat this monster so quickly, I was not sure, but as Pakistan won the war of terror, it should be taught as a case study. In fact, one of our problems has also been that they are hesitant to praise us that there is no 'label' on us, perhaps the reason is that nowadays itself is very good. The existence of separatist armed organizations around the world is nothing new. Why go away, there is Sri Lanka in the armpit, where the Tamil Tigers launched a separation movement for many years aimed at establishing an independent state in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka called Tamil Elam. The Tamil rebels occupied the Sri Lankan city of Jaffna and had practically made it their capital, which means the Sri Lankan government's writ was not there. The Tamil Tigers fought armed for decades and took all violent ways, including suicide attacks, which were declared by several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union globally. Finally, in 2009, the Tamil rebels suffered a complete defeat by the Sri Lankan army, and thus their struggle failed. Sri Lanka can do this, so why not? There is no doubt that Balochistan has extreme poverty, the mineral resources of the province did not reach the people, gas was removed from the needle to the last district of Punjab, but the stoves of the Baloch houses remained cool and many of the kinds of things that have been a source of fact, if they have a true message. But this is one side of the picture; In another post, the nationalist leader who posted a letter of statement wrote that Gwadar was part of Balochistan from the first day, so no one should be confused that if Pakistan bought Gwadar from Oman, it is a part of Balochistan. Anjanab began in 1783 and told how Gwadar had gone to Oman from time to time due to the throne fighting, and the British did not even deal with the situation, after which Pakistan just withdrew it and nothing else. Dear Dear here, the history of the history was mixed. The first question is, why should the talk start from 1783, why not start thirteen billion years ago when the universe came from the Big Bang! And if it was to start from 1783, then Gwadar stayed with Oman for a hundred years. In that period, no Baloch leader tried to get this mother homeland by the force of a gun, and when he became Pakistan, no chief did not think that his land was resolved by the Prime Minister. The defendant is just that every Pakistani is with the Baloch nation in the deprivation of Balochistan, but that does not mean that the facts should be distorted and the questions regarding the geography of Balochistan should be asked which India does not even do. In Balochistan, the terrorists are spreading the same statement that has no historical certificate. And regardless of all this debate, the kind of brutal acts that these terrorists are conducting in Balochistan will also end the statement of oppression which led them to sympathy in the media. There will continue to be a scholarly debate on Balochistan, currently we have to set up a state writ on one of Balochistan, and its way is to fight this war of terror as we have fought in the past.

Leaders of major political parties participated in the Oxford University's Blootonic School of Government, after the elections, participated in the discussion of the national facts and the panel on the future where they appeared on one page. According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, the Pakistan Tehreek -e -Insaf (PTI) and senior leaders of the Pakistan Muslim League -N participated online in a conversation by Oxford University Associate Professor Adeel Malik and Professor Maya Tudor. Pakistan Muslim League -N leader Ahsan Iqbal asked questions regarding the legal status of elections, his party's links with the establishment, the slogans of his party in the past 'honor the vote' and the crackdown on Imran Khan and his party. Students questioned PTI leader Hamad Azhar about whether the PTI has gone out of the crisis and whether his party is a cohesive political force. Former Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader and former Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar also became part of the panel, who, along with the ongoing protests in Balochistan and Sindh, took a stand on the challenges facing the consequences in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which has taken a political crisis. He said, \\u201cPolitical uncertainty will remain while the path to move forward is not smooth. The country is currently about to complete the IMF bailout program and will need a new program worth about $ 6 billion, which will create more difficult conditions for the public. Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that a mixed government formed by the PML -N and the PPP would be 'an unpopular government that does not have the credibility of living in the government'. Talking about his party's success in the elections, Hamad Azhar called it a 'resistance to the Pakistani people against oppression and fear. He repeatedly talked about alleged election fraud and said that the results of fraud are being made public. He added, \\\"There is no scope for blackout and censorship in modern society. This effort to spread fear in society will not work. PTI workers were detained, imprisoned, tortured, blackout and forced to hide, but the people of Pakistan did not bow down to oppression. ' Terming the elections as a \\\"peaceful revolution\\\", Hamad Azhar insisted that his party had 'won 183 seats in the National Assembly' but 'the scenario changed by rigging in Form 47'. He emphasized that the Pakistani people are 'losing hopes of their representative institutions' and in this regard, he also named the Election Commission of Pakistan and the High Court. Hamad Azhar took the stand that 'the people are disappointed with the state, which is a dangerous thing. We need a political system where many political parties are in power. People are already facing anger due to economic channels. ' PML -N leader Ahsan Iqbal emphasized that \\\"no institution can solve Pakistan's problems\\\", and PTI talks about the views of political parties being in power, so in this regard, the element of 'agreeing and recognizing and recognizing it is necessary. Ahsan Iqbal said, \\\"PTI states that if you are not with us then you are corrupt, traitors.\\\" They do not leave room for any party. ' \\u201cToday, the party accused of establishment was the same establishment in 2017, which removed Nawaz Sharif from the post of Prime Minister. For four years, the party gave the establishment a free hand to run the country. ' He took the stand that 'when Pakistan and India were on the verge of war, the Army Chief came to brief the opposition in Parliament, but Imran Khan refused to sit with the opposition. Even when India merged occupied Kashmir, they refused to sit with us. The PTI understands that he is a representative of patriotism alone, a problem. ' On the allegations of fraud, the PML -N leader derived it as a 'difference between idea and reality' and 'success of social media' and insisted that if the results on Form 45 were different, it could be challenged in the courts. The panel also discussed the balance of power between Pakistan's public and military institutions. While Hamad Azhar accused the opposition parties of gaining military support despite advance promises, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar expressed regret over the return of political instability that reminded him of the 1990s. Former Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said, \\\"The parties who said they would not look at the army for support, they not only tried to seek support but hoped that it would help them win the elections.\\\" The panel members also highlighted the elimination of public confidence in the institutions and the electoral process and warned of possible consequences if the Pakistani people did not remove the grievances. Ahsan Iqbal called for respecting the electoral process and condemned the 'discriminatory rhetoric spread by some political factions'. Hamad Azhar said that the establishment puts itself behind the scenes and 'police do their job with the FIA'. He added, \\\"The only way to move forward is to trust the people that they can take their own destiny decisions.\\\" The PTI is working as a nursery to lead the future. Public sentiment is so strong that it is not only the present but the future. I have seen PTI's flexibility, endurance and lower levels appear in the party. ' On this occasion, the student asked the important question whether the slogan of 'Honor the vote' was used to pressure the establishment, on which Ahsan Iqbal 'disagreed'. He said that his party had taken a principled stand on maintaining the supremacy of the constitution. He criticized Imran Khan as a \\\"fascist party leader\\\" and asked those who supported him why he appointed people like Usman Bazdar and Ali Amin Gandapur.

The meaning of the term \\\"peace\\\" means to achieve its protection and freedom from war and violence, while the second path of peace is called peace, which brings up an environment free of thought, problems, noisy or unwanted disruption. What does the word \\\"peace\\\" mean for Chinese people and what Americans think about it, both are moving in the opposite side of each other, especially those belonging to Christianity who emphasize a lot of peace of peace, their opinion is quite different. Peace and fear are complicated and they cannot be separated. Too much fear often ends and destroys peace and provoke wars. Terrorism is a feature of groups that create fear by sowing the seeds of terror. Through the brutal acts, hatred and often kill innocent civilians and kills. It is a disgusting process that is far beyond the understanding of the common man. Fear is a very important factor in the psychological credibility of peace and terrorism. The state apparently never seems to be afraid of terrorists, but people are very afraid of terrorism and are mentally affected. This fear is sometimes exaggerated by the constant exaggerations of politicians and the media, the conditions spread in the psychological background of the parties' behavior. When the decision to tackle the danger is more affected by the emotion of the intellect, the lack of confidence causes anxiety to spread rapidly and the fear for personal, political interests increases. As a result, the deteriorating situation of political and economic and law and order does not appear to be a comprehensive and objective solution to the nature of the crisis, the threshold limit and the ability to control, resulting in the decisions and the impact on their social life into extreme fear. Invalid strategic goals cannot achieve internal peace, which eventually pose a risk of losing strategic attention and control. Although false strategic goals often reduce the sensitivity of the risk, increase the risk of apathy. Chinese people always prefer to look forward to the beginning of the year, which does not mean that they forget their past, but they want to find peace with a wider mentality. The famous Chinese literary figure of the Song Family (1279-960), Sushi, has written a memorial titled \\\"To calm the waves\\\", which Chinese citizens are seen reading in short videos on the arrival of the New Year to express a wide-ranging view that is overwhelming. It can also be estimated how the Chinese people view \\\"victory\\\" in the middle of the peace and war. When we mention the elimination of terrorism and extremism in the Chinese province of Xinjiang in the near future, peace was established under poverty alleviation program. Locals were saved from extremist thinking by providing equal opportunities for development. Local, traditional, cultural activities, dance, music, art promotion, the region was removed from the state of fear and made a living example in front of the world. The difference between Chinese and US policy makers is that China gives a message of peace to the world's economies, so the United States is afraid and fought for wars for its \\\"victory\\\". Both routes are open in front of Pakistan's policy makers. Wisdom tells him that the snake should die and the sticks do not break. In a state of fear, restrictions on social, political, cultural, literary activities, the efforts of politicians and workers to be removed from the scene are not the solution to the problems of the whole of Pakistan, including Balochistan. Akhtar Mengal or Abdul Malik Baloch, Month Rang Baloch or Maulana Hidayat -ur -Rehman, they are all our own. Their voices have pain and discomfort. Instead of being scared, feel their pain, they need to dialogue with them. If the people of Agar Baloch are caught in their love, then respond to the voice of the people, let them openly speak openly in the open fields, elected houses. These people will find solutions to the problems of Balochistan. The weak provincial governments of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should save their power in the fight against terrorists or stand with the state for fear of terrorism, harassment of terrorists can not protect the people nor make peace.\"}, {\"title\": \"\\\"Pakistan is struggling to establish parallel relations with China and the United States\\\"\", \"date\": \"2025-02-10\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"terrorism, economic crisis\", \"content\": \"During a recent visit to China, President Asif Ali Zardari reaffirmed his commitment to strategic partnership with China. In a meeting with Chinese leaders, especially Chinese President Xi Jinping, the President of Pakistan called for opening new doors to cooperation on the Pak-China Economic Transit (C-PAC). He visited an important time when terrorism and security challenges in Pakistan are causing trials for bilateral relations with China. The visit was also important in the sense that President Asif Ali Zardari's party is in power in Pakistan Peoples Party Balochistan and Sindh, two provinces where Chinese citizens were targeted in recent terrorist attacks. The attacks led to serious concerns, which led to pressure on the government to ensure the protection of Chinese citizens in the country. Although it is true that security matters take over the establishment, provincial governments are responsible for the enforcement of laws and policymaking. This bilateral cooperation is essential to tackling the threat of terrorism. It is a priority to attract more Chinese investment, whether they are under the banner of investment C -Pack 2.0 or other bilateral economic projects. Although Pakistan's strategic and defense relations with Beijing are strong, it is intended to strengthen their foreign policy stance, especially with regard to relations with the United States and the West. However, Chinese investors are reluctant to invest here due to security risks, uncertainty of debt repayment, bureaucratic issues and bureaucracy. It is important to maintain mutual trust that Pakistan should ensure the safety of Chinese citizens. The horrific security threat has strained bilateral relations, which shows that by strong measures, Pakistan will have to convince China that it is committed to protecting its interests. Most of the two countries reiterate their commitment to strengthen bilateral economic and security cooperation. But the progress made to deal with these obstacles is very slow, the Pakistani establishment often seems to make promises that have a serious implementation. For example, after two important incidents of attack on Chinese citizens last year, Interior Minister Mohsen Naqvi agreed to formulate a joint security strategy with China. The agreement was finalized during a meeting with Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong after an extremist incident in Karachi, injuring two Chinese nationals in the firing of a security guard. However, national and international media reports suggested that the joint security mechanism may not be effective because Pakistan does not allow the presence of foreign troops on its territory, besides joint military exercises or related activities. Pakistan intensified its counter -terrorism efforts for China's happiness and intensified the crackdown in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, important security challenges are in place. In addition, the details of the proposed security arrangements are not clear. What does China want? He wants to directly protect his citizens, to create an internal security setup that is jointly involved in the security personnel of both countries? Moreover, which Chinese security personnel will be included in it? Will they be part of a private contractor or normal local security structure? All these details are vague. However, it is clear that China has made active efforts to develop such a mechanism, but further explanation is needed by Pakistan. Although Pakistan and China have deep security cooperation in several levels, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the special structure of C -Pack Security, their multi -level cooperation faces various challenges. During the President's visit to China, the Home Minister was also part of the delegation and met with his counterpart Public Security Minister Qijan Yanjan to increase intelligence sharing and deepen counter -terrorism cooperation. The meeting was of special importance. The meeting took place at a time when reports were circulating recently that Mohsin Naqvi attended an event organized by the anti -Chinese government organization in the United States, while the interior minister denied him. The incident was seen as another challenge in promoting trust between the two countries. China has never objected to Pakistan's active relations with the West, but is aware that Pakistan and the United States have a long history of bilateral relations. In fact, the US relations with Pakistan are also in the interest of Beijing, for example, in the 1970s Pakistan facilitated a secret meeting between Zhou Nai and Henry Kissinger. However, the reasons for Beijing's concerns are something else. China does not want Pakistan to take advantage of its relations with Beijing and build its relations with Washington at the same time, especially when relations between Pakistan and the United States are strained. China's views about Mohsin Naqvi are close to Pakistan's military establishment rather than being an important part of Pakistan's civilian government. If Mohsin Naqvi was present in Washington during Donald Trump's oath -taking ceremony, China sees it from a different point of view, that is, Pakistan wants to maintain its financial assistance through the IMF and the World Bank. Their main concern is that Pakistan's reliance on international financial institutions affects many factors, such as the payment of loans to the C -Pack, to maintaining the privacy of the project. Pakistan is struggling to balance its relations with China and the West. Some close advisers to the military establishment, including former diplomats and generals, advocate close ties with China, saying that China's rise is different from the rise of the Soviet Union. However, the establishment is facing long -term consequences and implications to rely on a global power, especially in the question of how such a relationship will be useful in strategic, political and economic cooperation. The situation becomes more complicated by Pakistan's security focus on India, while it also seriouss challenges like the Taliban government and its wider strategic framework. Despite these complications, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Planning are excited that China will start work this year on two major mega projects Karakoram Highway Phase Two and ML One.

It was said that separatists, ie Khairbakhsh Murree and Sher Mohammad Sheriff, have done any mischief, then my attention went to the TV screen, the Prime Minister was discussing the situation in Quetta, every other minute camera focused on the face of Dr. Malik's face, because I was working with the owner of Balochistan and his good luck with his own names. There were, so the same phrase was coming to the mouth after Dr. Malik's face was coming in the camera. \\\"Every government has considered Balochistan as a politically politically.\\\" This phrase was common in Quetta. All the fronts of the front organizations made a block, everyone remembered the time when the body of Bugti Sahib was brought to a lock box in a lock, the people's anger was bathed all over Balochistan after that day, sometimes Hazara people are being killed, sometimes the Punjabis are watching the identity card, which is being shot in Balochistan. No attention has been paid, last year you will remember Baluchi and Gwadar people in the form of a large group of snow from the snowy areas of Turbat to Islamabad for the missing people, when they arrived in Islamabad, our government works, what is the work of the Taliban, and then the Taliban have returned to work. Two days later, when nothing was being made clear on the TV screen, the BBC was planted, there were Indian journalists speaking, thank God that on the third day, all the terrorists were killed and some of the 400 passengers were killed and some of them left their luggage in the morning, leaving their luggage in the morning. I was reminding all the people of the Baloch dignity, civilization, and then you may have seen the Prime Minister and the camera was repeatedly showing the face of Dr. Malik. After the death of Bugti Sahib in 2006, the Taliban did not even talk to the government and did not even talk to the government. There is a national leader and who is not, yet blasts and suicide attacks are underway in various places, Balochistan continues in Balochistan.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan: Terrorists take away seven passengers from a bus going from Quetta to Lahore\", \"date\": \"2025-02-19\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict\", \"content\": \"On the national highway in Barakhan district of Balochistan, armed terrorists killed seven passengers from the passenger coach after checking the identity cards.

In addition, in some areas of South Waziristan and KP, the same situation is the same situation. Due to the full experience of the internal political front, political instability has completely destroyed the economy. People have become alive in the hands of inflation and unemployment. Due to climate change, natural disasters and floods have also completed the shortage. As if our actions are angry with us. Despite the rulers' high claims, hopes for improvement are rapidly diminishing. There is no doubt that today we are surrounded by severe internal and external threats, and that the ruling people have no solution to this problem and are not ready to go to the group, which is a possible solution. It has also been confirmed that they are the separatist groups behind the ongoing unrest and terrorist attacks in Balochistan, which have been engaged in the Emma of Pakistan's enemy forces for a long time. Those who have now been backing the external forces who want to end the C -Pack project, which make them a thwarting plan to access China's outside world.

And as before, the battle of the elephants is going to be destroyed. Remember that before we have been the tool of US imperialism against the Soviet Union for more than fifty years. And in the name of so -called Afghan jihad, his forgotten youths threw into the fire of terror. Today, our identity has been affected in the outside world. The Afghans who sheltered millions in their country, fostered heroin and Kalashnikov culture and destroyed their economy. Today, against the Afghan Taliban Pakistan, Pakistan has become the tool of enemy forces. Now we have not been able to handle the war of interests of the former Soviet Union and the United States, so we are now being made the battlefield of American and Chinese interests. It is our misfortune that our geographical events that led to which we could gain many national interests for ourselves became the enemy of our existence. Due to such an event, its positive results could only be achieved only if we created internal political stability and allowed international sensible decisions to make political leadership, but the conspiracy to form and demolish governments has made us so weakened so much that we have become helpless.

According to the Dawn newspaper, the government has introduced an important bill in the National Assembly, demanding the army and civilian forces to be given the authority to be detained for three months of terrorist charges. The Anti -Terrorism Act 1997 in the National Assembly was presented by Federal Minister for Law Nazir Tarad, after which Deputy Speaker Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah sent the bill to the concerned committee. The bill also includes provisions to set up joint investigative teams (JIT) comprising members of various law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies. The same amendments to the ATA clause 11 EEEE in Peshawar were introduced in the context of a terrorist attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar. According to the bill, \\\"the purpose of re -incorporating Section 11 EEEE amendments of the Law is to give the government, armed forces and civilian armed forces the necessary authority to detain those who are threatened with national security.\\\" This clause will allow the suspects to be carefully detained on the basis of certified information or doubt, which will be thwarted before the terrorist plans are performed. The amendment will also provide law enforcement agencies to legal support for more effective acts against terrorism, which will help JITs, comprising members of various law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies, conduct a comprehensive investigation and collect viable intelligence '. The bill states that in 2014, Section 11 EEE of the ATA was amended, which gave the government and the authorized armed forces and civilian armed forces the authority to take care of the suspects involved in terrorism activities. However, the amendment was subject to a clause under which its term was restricted to 2 years, which expired in 2016. The bill added that \\\"besides the current security situation, a strong response is needed that is beyond the current legal framework.\\\" There will be the authority to be detained, but for more than 3 months the detention of any person will be subject to the clause of Article 10 of the Constitution.

According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, the Round Table Conference, organized by the Islamabad Policy Investite (IPI), titled 'The growing security crisis of Balochistan', discussed possible options for stability in the country and reducing the crisis for the situation in the province. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed criticized the failure to implement important reports by other governments that could empower Balochistan politically and economically, including the 2005 report of the parliamentary committee on Balochistan and the recently missing persons by the Islamabad High Court.\\nAnother report made is included. Mushahid Hussain Syed also expressed regret over the failure of Shahbaz government in accepting the offer of resolving the missing persons by legislating on the arrest of those involved in terrorism and espionage by former Army Chief Retired General Qamar Bajwa. To resolve these issues, Mushahid Hussain Syed suggested a five -point agenda, which includes implementation of pre -compiled reports, strengthening security relations between Pakistan and Iran, empowering Balochistan Chief Minister to find a solution to the problem of terrorism locally, and using Shanghai to protect Balochistan.  IPI Chairperson Dr Shireen Mazari criticized the government's security approach in the province, which gave the province a military military and people started to feel themselves alone. Shirin Mazari said that foreign investment, especially in projects like Pak -China Economic Corridor (C -Pack), can only be successful when locals are involved, he warned that government policies are causing instability and resentment in the region. At the conference, Abdul Basit, a Fellow of Singapore, Singapore, spoke on the concept of comparative deprivation, how education and social media have deepened the concept of the exploitation of Baloch students. He said that it is worth noting that the terrorist group Balochistan Liberation Army's strategy has become firm, which shows their ability to destroy their infrastructure skillfully and the use of media to spread their message. Dr. Maria Malik, Assistant Professor of Quaid -e -Azam University Islamabad, called for eliminating militancy in Balochistan and respect for the dignity and unique identity of the local population.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan University suffers from problems\", \"date\": \"2024-04-10\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, humanitarian situation\", \"content\": \"I am repeatedly requesting in these columns that foreign policy can be achieved only by connecting the economy at all times. Similarly, it is important for the continuation of this success to link the educational field with it and set goals in the education sector regularly set global and local needs and set goals on how much development of the educational sector, how much degree holders can be achieved after it can be achieved. So first of all, it is very important to examine the role of the universities, not only the government universities but also the private sector universities, to achieve this goal. It is very sad to see that despite the good number of universities in the private sector, there has been no significant research work from them, though they receive heavy fees, after which they have no excuse for not doing research work, but unfortunately there is no better idea of \\u200b\\u200bthis. While using their influence while using their influence, government universities are not allowing them to flourish, and one thing is clear that the government universities are fond of public attention, though government universities are more likely to provide more education than the poor and the poor are more likely than the universities of the private sector. This problem does not seem to be solving. Punjab University is not only Punjab but one of the ancient universities of the subcontinent. His past is very bright, but he has the same problem. If the current temporary Vice -Chancellor is intended to be maintained on these occasions, then they should be made permanent, but the path of the Ad Hawk policy must be abandoned. The problems of the universities cannot be improved due to the absence of more effective strategies than financial matters, otherwise they will not be corrected. Dr. Amjad Magsi, president of the Punjab University Academic Staff Union, has very useful and viable suggestions in this regard. During General Musharraf's time, he wrote a PhD dissertation on Nawaz Sharif's politics. When Dr. Amjad Magsi was writing a PhD dissertation on this topic, Prof. Dr. Musarrat Abid contacted me these days and told me that the PMLN's people who have been part of the Nawaz Sharif government in the past are also so afraid that Amjad Magsi does not want to talk to Magsi. He is also well aware of politics and educational strategies. If the Chief Minister meets them and takes suggestions for solving the problems of the University teachers and the university, then this problem can easily be saved. Similarly, Prof. Dr. Kaleemullah Barrich, President of the Federation of All Pakistan University Staff Association and Balochistan University Academic Staff Association, has long been very active for paying the salaries and pensioners of Balochistan University, and it is not possible to pay for the last four months. Professor Dr. Karimullah says exactly that if these people are not satisfied with economic affairs, then they can be expected to provide a higher level of education. They have gone a symbolic campaign to draw the attention of the authorities to these issues, and this year, they have also been set up in a camp to solve the problems of salaries and pensioners in front of the President of Balochistan University. In view of the sensitive situation of Balochistan, it should be a priority to solve this problem in the first time, but when such a priority will be and no one knows.\"}]",
         "The situation in Kachhi reveals significant stressors impacting food security. The smuggling of wheat and essential commodities, coupled with inflation, directly affects food availability and accessibility. Economic conditions are dire, with high unemployment and poverty rates. Households are resorting to negative coping strategies like asset sales and reduced meals.\n\nEnvironmental challenges, including severe floods and heavy rains, have caused displacement and infrastructural damage. These events have disrupted transportation and markets, further complicating food access.\n\nThe weather data shows periods of minimal precipitation and extreme temperatures, contributing to poor agricultural productivity and limited food access. These compounded issues suggest that Kachhi is likely to experience 'Crisis' (IPC Phase 3) conditions during the prediction period, with significant food gaps and reliance on crisis coping strategies being evident.",

According to the Dawn newspaper, Akhtar Mengal emphasized that the protest will continue till the release of women leaders of all the detained Baloch Solidarity Committee (BYC), including Dr. Mah Rang Baloch, and the protesters are not allowed to enter Quetta peacefully. The government delegation, headed by provincial minister Zahoor Ahmad Balidi, met with the BNP (M) including Akhtar Mengal, Agha Musa Jan, Sajid Tareen Advocate, Mir Akhtar Hussain Lango, Sana Baloch and Mir Haram Kalamati. The delegation cited security concerns and travel barriers for residents of Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for the reasons for ending the sit -in. However, Akhtar Mengal said, \\\"We have one -point agenda, and that is the release of Dr. Month Rang and other women prisoners.\\\"  The BNP -MI protests in Lakpas entered their third day on Sunday, in which hundreds of participants closed important routes, the local administration has refused to allow marches to enter Quetta. As a result of the protests, residents of 12 districts, including Mastung, Kalat, Surab, Khuzdar, Hub, Lasbela, Noshki, Kharan, Dalbandin, Nakandi and Wasak, are facing travel difficulties before Eid -ul -Fitr. The provincial administration has tightened security to prevent the BNPM's long march from entering Quetta, and shipping containers and obstacles have been set up on Lakpas Tunnel, Kund Missouri, Agaberg and other important entrances. Hundreds of passengers have been trapped due to the blockade and cannot return home on holiday, while patients with limited access are facing difficulties in reaching hospitals. A delegation of Jamiat Ulema -e -Islam (F) Balochistan visited the BNP (M) sit -in camp under the leadership of Senator Maulana Abdul Waas, and discussed the current situation besides expressing solidarity.  The delegation included Senator Kamran Murtaza Advocate, MPA Nawabzada Mir Zafarullah Zahri and Mir Usman Pirkani. During his visit, representatives of JUI -F spoke to BNP (M) leaders and informed their views on the protest and the government's response. Despite repeated demands of the talks, the Balochistan government has stopped the Long March of the BNPM for the third consecutive day, which has led to the disconnection of several districts of Quetta, which has affected thousands of people, especially those who are traveling for Eid celebrations. On Sunday, authorities further tightened sanctions by imposing additional containers in Kund Missouri and Agaberg, which effectively disconnected Quetta's important internal and external routes. The move has doubled the problems of the citizens.\"}, {\"title\": \"'First Barrier Crossed', BNP-Mangal's Long March against crackdown on Baloch Activist\", \"date\": \"2025-03-28\", \"location\": \"Kalat\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, economic crisis\", \"content\": \"Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mangal) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal has said that his party's 'peaceful' long march has reached Kalat against alleged harassment of Baloch women and children and has taken the first obstacle to the law enforcement personnel to stop it.

In a post on X today, Sardar Akhtar Mengal said that a peaceful long march successfully crossed the government's first obstacle on the way. He said that law enforcement personnel dressed in plain clothes tried to provoke our people, but our commitment to a peaceful march is unnecessary.  He added that all petrol stations from Khuzdar to Quetta were sealed, which is an attempt to \\\"access basic needs\\\".

Despite the bold acts of Pakistan and the sacrifices of Pakistan, serious terrorist incidents are commonplace. According to the ISPR yesterday, 18 personnel were martyred during the operation of security forces in Qalat, while 23 terrorists were killed during the operation against terrorists in Kalat during the last 24 hours and 23 terrorists during the Pak army operation in Harnai. According to the Pakistan Army Department of Relations, the terrorists tried to block the road in Mangochar area of \\u200b\\u200bQalat district, which failed 12 terrorists, while 18 Balochistan FC personnel were also martyred while fighting the terrorists. According to ISPR, 11 terrorists were killed in Harnai. The banned BLA has claimed responsibility for the attack on forces in Kalat. Army Chief General Asim Munir arrived in Balochistan and attended the funeral of the martyrs of Pak army and received direct awareness from the situation. He expressed the belief that whatever the so -called friendly enemies should do anything, they must be defeated. The sacrifices of the Army Chief's commitment to end terrorism are undoubtedly valuable, but in the context of the situation facing the counter -terrorism operations, the reasons for the end of terrorism are also inevitable. Last year was the worst year of the last decade in terms of terrorism. According to the Center for Research and Security Studies, this year there were a total of 444 terrorist attacks in the country, in which at least 685 members of the security forces lost their lives. In these incidents, a total of 1,612 people were killed and 934 militants were killed in these incidents. The total casualties that were recorded this year are the highest in the last nine years and are more than 66 % in 2023. The violence caused the most damage in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 1616 people were killed while 782 people were killed in Balochistan. According to the CRSS report, a total of 2,546 people were killed in hundreds of incidents of violence in the country in 2024, including civilians, security forces, and all of them. Despite the full counter -terrorism military operations, there is no sign of the reduction of terrorist incidents this year after last year. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, militant attacks in January increased by 42 % over December. 74 militant attacks killed 120 people, including 52 security personnel, 20 civilians and 48 militants across the country. The reason for this is that only counter -terrorism is being focused on dealing with the problem, there is no specific arrangement for determining and remedy the causes of terrorism. For this purpose, the widespread consultation of political, military and public circles and research institutions is effective in implementing the situation.\"}, {\"title\": \"Operation in Qalat and Harnai, 18 young martyrs, 23 terrorists killed, Army Chief arrives in Balochistan\", \"date\": \"2025-02-02\", \"location\": \"Kalat\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict\", \"content\": \"Rawalpindi, Karachi (News Agencies, News Desk) During the operation of security forces in Qalat, 18 young men were martyred. 18 FC personnel were also martyred, according to ISPR, 11 terrorists were killed during effective action against terrorists in Harnai.

See the silence of the sky peaks on the hills on the slums with a horrific thunder. \\\"Why does this town become slaughtered at night?\\\" These days we are going through such a phase of change and imitation. The world stands on the brink of a major economic volcano. Exactly a century ago, the US economy was spreading rapidly. The banks were lending on easy terms. The profitability of business activities was being made on the stock exchange and then October 1928 arrived. While watching, the stock market collapsed. Unemployment in the United States reached 25 %. One -third of the farmers lost their land. Of the 25 thousand banks closed. The volume of the US economy decreased by 30 %. It also had an inevitable impact on Europe and Japan. The global economy declined by 15 %. The economic crisis was born by political extremism. The recession of 1929 eventually ended on World War II. In the 1933 US elections, Roosevelt won the New Deal, whose main point was the cost of urban welfare. However, the economic crisis around the world had become a political chaos. Fascism had sold his dreams to the masses. There was a civil war in Spain. Japan was on the path to war. In Russia, Stalin had spread terror. As a result, World War I have taken the ransom of eight million lives. On the one hand, the United Nations was born on the one hand, and on the other hand, nuclear weapons and the Cold War created a new world. The Cold War has eliminated the possibility of World War I, but wrengthening dozens of face -to -face wars in Korea, Vietnam, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. When the Cold War ended in the early nineties, the Communist block was scattered. The European Union was formed. However, the prospects of democratic dreams and human rights were abducted by a major capitalist in the new world. The triangle of hatred, terrorism and popularity has taken the 21st century back and forth. Trump's success in the United States has not only harassed the US economy, the basic principles of NATO, established since the century, have also become smoke. The Middle East, Ukraine, Taiwan and the Greenland are on the brink of war. The US Air Force has arrived in Digaria, 4,000 km from the Iranian border. Trump has pushed the global economy into uncertain waters by the remarkable rise in imports. In it, the flour of a poor country like Pakistan will be more wet. The United States was the only country in which Pakistan was in profit in trade but where the rest of the world could not get discount, what does Pakistan sell? The global crisis is still opening up and it will create a global map of the 21st century. Pakistan is marginalized in this global crisis but is suffering from four major internal crisis. Despite the elected government and parliament, the democratic system stands on the straw. Regardless of the economy's curriculum, there is no form of economic recovery, foreign investment, trade and industrial development. Pakistan never went through such a colorless and uncertain political season. Even in the crisis in East Pakistan, at least it was clear that there was a fundamental contradiction among the militant groups. Today, it is difficult to explain what the political situation will be by the end of this year. The second crisis is a crisis of trust in federal units. Punjab and other provinces are not fully aware of the anxiety and sensitivity found on the construction of new canals in Sindh. It is also important to understand that Sindh has been peaceful at a satisfactory level in recent years. This federal unit should be protected from the conflict. The question of terrorism is now divided into three pieces. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister is not in favor of action against religious terrorists, so the decisions of the National Security Parliamentary Committee belong to Balochistan only. One part of the unrest in Balochistan is armed resistance and the other is related to political rights. Balochistan's politics have been running on unidentified signals since quarter century. Such a government can satisfy the Baloch people and do not have a relationship with the federal. The Baloch crisis demands action against armed groups and negotiations with political forces. The signs of this tactic are not yet seen. There are reports of backward talks with Afghanistan, but it would be a pleasure to understand that the Afghan occupation government will be able to end cooperation with the TTP. Pakistan's fourth crisis is economic and economic indicators at the ground level are not encouraging. Instead of being happy with the extraordinary activity on the stock exchange, its potential stimulations need to be considered. At the administrative level, the state -of -the -art authority is not satisfactory. Pakistan is arrested in a claw of economic interests. Non -political supremacy on political decision -making in the country has taken hostage of economic prospects. Important political forces are waiting for the affairs of the PTI and the ruling.

These are the three news reports that have been published in the last few days when the news has been published in the news. Let's do that which has become commonplace in this country. Small accidents are no longer counted, in the last few days, such horrific accidents have occurred that the man is shaking thinking, but it is possible for someone to ring. It is not right for the government to do everything, when 90 % of citizens go to violate the law, no government in the world can run a traffic system. Some of you may find 90 % of things exaggerated, but such people may not be driving, or they may be less driving out. Riding a car or motorcycle in this country is no longer less than a punishment, of course you are going in the right direction, not violating any indicators, slowing down, and keeping a look to the left, but there is no guarantee that you will not have an accident, because it is possible to suddenly be shocked and drunk. Gillers are killed. Accidents on national highways are even more terrifying, in such accidents, the negligence of the driver is lost dozens of valuable lives. But our attitude has become so strange that now we do not find anything wrong, if anyone stops the car to misunderstand or tell me that the four children are on the motorcycle by rapidly violating the one -way, how much do you feel in the heart of the heart. Sometimes I feel that even if our economy is good as a result of a miracle, our ignorant attitude will take us. Balochistan. What do you write? Traffic accidents had made it so burdensome that the news of Balochistan came today. There were 50 deaths in one day, 23 of them were shot dead by terrorists from buses and trucks in Musa Khel. When read the details of the news, the heart trembled. 30 to 40 terrorists blocked the highway going from Punjab to Balochistan, stopped 22 vehicles and searched them, removed the Punjabis and selected them, and also set fire to 23 vehicles. I consider myself a lot of progressive, wherever people fight for their rights and do not care about their lives and property in this regard, I envy how great these people are, but despite all their 'progressive' I do not consider the Baloch movement a metaphor for any kind of resistance. Perhaps I should not issue such a two -way statement because it is not wise, writing should be such that tomorrow the servant can interpret his will, but my intellectuals have been answered here. This process, however, cannot be justified. For a minute we assume that those who are 'fighting this war of the Baloch people' are good intentions and we are here in our drawing room and are unaware of the atrocities that their family and wife have to pass through, in which case these terrorist acts will not benefit their 'cause'. The sympathy that is found in Punjab for these people will end, and these people will not be able to defeat the state. I often think that if I was a ruler and this news was kept at my desk in the morning, I would have been more worried about the news, on the terror of Balochistan or the IMF agreement. And then what did my trouble do, do I just have something? Let's assume that the IMF's issue as the ruler gives more importance because the police, the army and the Rangers had to be vigilant to handle the security situation, at least it would have been done on the bus, but what would have done the IMF's condition under which Pakistan would make a $ 7 billion deal to ensure their debt. How difficult it is. Think for a minute if you want to borrow some from your friend, how are you ashamed to talk about it, and if you have to do this repeatedly and spread your hands in front of another friend after another and this work has been done eight to ten times and the friends start demanding repayment of the loan, which I will say, because I will feel more about it.

The nature of the agreement turned around and turned towards common security issues. On this agreement, on February 26, 1955, Dawn hoped that Pakistan would soon become part of the deal and wrote that \\\"long -born space in the region has made it an easy target of aggression.\\\" But when Hilal, from Karachi to Istanbul, was strengthened through the steel of defense agreements, which eventually leads to a joint coalition, the resulting force will inevitably prove to be a path to aggression. \\\" Pakistan was trying to resolve the issues that were in the way of its relations with India and that is why the then Governor General Ghulam Muhammad visited India from January 25 to 28, 1955. Do not recognize the fact that Pakistan had serious threats to security from India and Afghanistan from the very beginning of Independence. It also made many mistakes. Santo had the patronage of the United Kingdom and the United States, but there was a lot of opposition in the Arab world. Egypt's Foreign Minister Mahmoud Fawazi strongly condemned the Iraqi move. In different cities of Syria, demonstrations started against it. The Soviet Union's Communist Party spokesman Prauda wrote that \\\"this is a military agreement.\\\" These statements are absolutely wrong that Turkey and Iraq want to strengthen the security of the region. The Soviet Union cannot ignore all these secret conspiracies. \\\"Pakistan said in March 1955 that\\\" this is an important step towards a security system that should also naturally be related to Pakistan because of its geographical position. Shortly before, it was a matter of time in East Pakistan, \\\"he said. The person was In 1954, the Muslim League's opposition coalition was badly lost to the United Front. The United Front won two hundred and thirty -three, while the Muslim League barely won ten seats. The most important topic of these elections was the military relations between Pakistan and the United States, which was strongly opposed by the United Front. Opposition political parties organized processions in Bengal to celebrate the day against US and Pakistan military agreements. One hundred and sixty -two newly elected members of the East Bengal Provincial Assembly signed a statement condemning the military agreement with the United States. It should be noted that the usefulness or disadvantages of these agreements are not under discussion at this time, but I am only describing the gulf born in both arms of the country based on them. Due to these circumstances, not only did Pakistan have complete disagreement with the provincial level regarding the foreign policy of Pakistan, but also the complete disagreement with the two arms on defense issues began to prepare for national security. However, shortly afterwards, Hussein Shaheed Suhrawardy, the president of the Awami League and the most important leader of the United Front, also held the position of Prime Minister of Pakistan, but the thinking of the thinking went away. The idea of \\u200b\\u200brepeating all of this has come to the point that since the economic partnership of Pakistan has been established, the anxiety that has repeatedly raised its head in Balochistan has been found to be a slogan as opposed to this economic partnership. Now the recent sit -in of the Baloch Solidarity Committee and the last permanent events are in the forefront. At this time, it seems that in order to consciously justify the ongoing unrest in Balochistan, it was taken to put women and children as shields and to somehow, to take the path of direct confrontation with the security agencies, God would not have to make some lives 'dust'. Therefore, it is imperative that the demands of Balochistan's resources first have the right of the locals there to be recognized in the true sense so that the idea of \\u200b\\u200blooking at security and foreign issues beyond the people of other provinces at any level in Balochistan can be eliminated because if the disagreement increases, such a thinking is very dangerous.\"}, {\"title\": \"How to extinguish fire in Balochistan - a few tips\", \"date\": \"2024-09-08\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, corruption, humanitarian situation, food insecurity\", \"content\": \"Balochistan, the western province of Pakistan, stands at a critical juncture. Its wide and mineral -rich land has immense potential, but this area is suffering from complex problems. Decading deprivation, security concerns, and resource distribution disputes have sown the seeds of dissatisfaction and instability. The solution to this problem requires a new perspective, which can utilize the true capacity of Balochistan by giving priority to reconciliation, joining development and shared prosperity. Restoration of lost trust, the basis of reconciliation: The process of healing begins with acknowledging that the Baloch people are historical complaints. The feeling of separation, the concept of injustice in the distribution of resources, the lack of sovereignty increased distribution and distribution. Openly recognizing these concerns, promoting the culture of dialogue, and establishing facts and reconciliation commissions, can pave the way for real understanding and healing. Strengthening Baloch sound, non -centrality and sovereignty: Balochistan needs real sovereignty within the framework of a united Pakistan. The empowerment of the Baloch people through the participation of the local community in the division of powers, the increase in the provincial authority and the participation of the local community in decision -making will promote a sense of ownership and responsibility. This includes a fair distribution of resources and transparent ways of benefits that directly meet the needs of the Baloch population, which are living in an unpredictable and irreversible geographical volume. There is now a new solution for this mass governance of this geographical area. Therefore, to replace Balochistan, all its civil divisions must be converted into states/units, which have increasing sovereignty and financial freedom. The move can lead to a new wave of economic development, which will lead to the removal of the poorest sections of the population from poverty. Shaliti development: The prosperity of Balochistan depends on the inclusion and sustainable development. Investing in education, health, agriculture, modern letters, investment in mining, tourism and infrastructure projects, especially the development of modern motorway networks, will create jobs, promote the economy, and improve the quality of life of all Balochs. Prioritizing skills development programs, helping local businesses, and ensuring fair access to economic opportunities will break the scope of poverty and promote self -reliance. Investing in young people, turning sports through sports: Balochistan's dynamic youths have positive opportunities. Activities focusing on sports promotion can lead to healthy hobbies by removing children and adults from negative effects. This investment in their physical and mental well -being will give birth to future leaders and supporters of the development of Balochistan. Taking lessons from Nelson Mandela's statement in this regard, it is suggested that the Pakistani government call this statement as its vision statement: \\\"Pakistan has the power to change Pakistan ... it has the power to move. It has the power to unite the Pakistani people as if no one else can speak to Pakistan. Sports can create hope for the entire Pakistani nation, where only frustration, unrest, hunger, unemployment, poverty, drugs, suicide attacks and economic hardships were a dangerous increase in suicide. It is more powerful than the government, breaking the terrorist monster, which has done a lot of damage to the country. Attachment to Balochistan, Infrastructure Revolution: A strong infrastructure network is essential to utilize Balochistan's capacity. A new end can be revolutionary, under a new enthusiasm, with a new enthusiasm under the China -Pakistan Economic Transit (CPEC) project, and with additional investment from friendly countries. Motorways network, water lanes and construction of dams, launching large -scale development projects in agriculture, tourism, and health sectors, combining communities, increasing economic activities, and improving Balochistan's strategic links. Cultural Protection: The colorful civilization of Balochistan is connected to the traditions and customs. Recognizing the Baloch language, heritage and art with the national identity of Pakistan and celebrating them will promote a sense of relationship and participation. Promoting cultural exchange programs, supporting local artists and artisans, and protecting the historical sites can strengthen the unity and diversity of Pakistani society. Adding all stakeholders: All stakeholders are essential to find a solution. Open and transparent dialogue between Baloch nationalists, political parties, civil society groups, security forces and the broader Pakistani community is very important to create a consensus and develop a viable plan for the future. Recognizing a different approach and finding a common basis is a key role in the formation of a future of shared prosperity and peace. As a result: Balochistan's future has immense hope. By giving priority to reconciliation, participation and sustainable development, Pakistan can turn the Balochistan issue into a common success story. The decisions made today will determine the destiny of the generations to come. Choosingly means that we should adopt a future where all Pakistanis, including the Baloch people, can really develop.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan: deteriorating conditions\", \"date\": \"2024-08-31\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, disruption to farming, humanitarian situation, lack of cultivation, restricted relief flights, mass hunger, food insecurity\", \"content\": \"We became light by writing about the worsening conditions of Balochistan.

In the war of power in Balochistan, the common Baloch has been badly falling. The problem begins with the imbalance of the vote bank between Baloch and Pashtuns and the blame is targeted by the ruling Punjabis in the federal government. When the Pashtuns are being politically strengthened instead of giving importance to the Balochs, obviously the Afghans are also associated with the Pashtuns who are affecting the Baloch vote bank by obtaining Pakistani identity and identity cards in the form of refugees. A long time ago, seven -day stay from Turbat to Quetta, personal observations during the road travel, the views of local Balochs and political and social figures were published in the same columns that it was revealed that the Zia era was against the Afghan jihad, which was against the Afghan jihad. At that time, the situation was slightly better than today but the storm was marking in the silent sea that Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan, was clearly divided into Baloch and Pashtun populations. The Baloch Pashtun could not live in the population and the Pashtuns were not ready to live with the Baloch. The Punjabis were afraid of the Balochs, which is why the Pashtun populations were forced to consider themselves more secure. Since the federal powerful institutions have the control of most of the people of Pakistan, the basic justification of hatred is made and it is a matter of fact that today Punjabi workers, skilled and traders are targeting BLA terrorists. The second most important reason for Balochistan's poor conditions is economic exploitation. All the projects, including the power, the power, the sandak and the mining, which we call the gold bird in them, rather than the interests of Balochistan, were rich by the local Baloch chiefs, politicians, but they did not spend a lot of money on the need for education and development of Balochistan. This has deepened the impression of deprivation and exploitation, due to lack of ordinary Baloch economic opportunities, Iranian petrol, diesel and other items have begun to rely on smuggling, now the feeling of being in strong hands in the guise of preventing smuggling is further increasing. Baloch youth, students and students are more conscious and talented than Punjabi, Sindhi youth. They want their name to be bright worldwide. But the Baloch sons and daughters were suspected that the only purpose to deprive them of the Internet is that the world could not see their faces. Now their identity has become something else. In Turbat, Gwadar, wherever the youths were talked about, their first suspicion was why they were being cut off from the world. Why is the federation afraid of them? It was a matter of time. Today, in a period of about four to five years, everything went out. No one has done anything to bring Baloch youth into the national mainstream. We celebrated the Baloch Culture Day and the Sindhi hat on the day of Ajark. A few dozen Baloch youths visit inter -provincial visits and keep in mind that they will go away. In Balochistan, our activities regarding health are confined to free medical camps rather than developing infrastructure. Hospitals were constructed at some places organized by the Pakistan Army but the civil role of the Balochistan government is nowhere to be seen. Even in Turbat, the situation was not under the control of the institutions. The local administration was afraid of the terrorists. The BLA terrorists were hiding in long mountain ranges, the general impression was that even the bird could not kill. The BLA terrorists used to get off the mountains at any time, turning to the cities, \\\"friendly fire\\\" and disappeared back into the mountains. They also had contact with the youth of the local population. Despite the mark, no one wondered how to control them. The strategy that you are happy with your home, we have failed. You have to think beyond that. Now the media of surrendering to some anonymous fray will not work. The martyrdom of 54 people, including the Pak army personnel, Punjabis, is testifying that the BLA terrorists have created a war situation by taking the form of a trusted force. Their operations would not be possible without a shadow of the neighborhood, distant countries. Just think that one day before August 26, Modi's plane passed away from Ukraine and passed the shadow of dishonesty in the atmosphere of Pakistan via Afghanistan. The next day, fire and blood holi were played in Balochistan. Is this just a coincidence, not at all? India has just suffered a wound in Bangladesh. Who is behind the bloodshed in Balochistan? There is silence on all sides, ah!

According to the Dawn newspaper Cairport, this was revealed by Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Mohammad Kakar, who also mentioned the names of doctors involved in taking double salaries. The list includes 36 medical officers, 29 female doctors and 9 dental surgeons, some of which are allegedly a member of the Young Doctors Association (YDA). Bakht Mohammad Kakar said that the health department has issued notices to these 74 doctors after identifying the issue and decided to take legal action. The health department has submitted evidence of corruption and plans to file an FIR against the accused. The Department of Health has also sought details of contract doctors from international organizations, including UN agencies, to ensure transparency. Health Minister Balochistan said that doctors whose deputation period has expired will be directed to return to their parent department.  He emphasized that the government will not tolerate irregularities in the health sector, with the actions of some people have damaged the reputation of the medical profession. He said that the closure of hospitals is unbearable for poor patients, and that the scene of their suffering is heartbreaking. Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind said that the list of doctors involved in the process identified the personal interests of harming the public health system. Meanwhile, the Young Doctors Association Pakistan has announced a 2 -hour symbolic strike in OPDs across the country today (Friday) in support of the Grand Health Alliance (GHA) Balochistan. The YDA condemned the retaliation against its members and warned that if the alleged harassment continued, the full boycott of the OPD would be started from Monday. In a statement, YDA Pakistan condemned false cases against officials of the Young Doctors Association Balochistan. The GHA has strike for the past 4 days and all doctors and other staff in hospitals across the province are absent from duty in favor of their demands. OPDs and operations are suspended in several major hospitals including Sandiman Provincial Hospital Quetta, Bolan Medical Complex Quetta, Sheikh Zayed Hospital and Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Hospital. Other affected hospitals include Mufti Mahmood Hospital Kachlak, Fatima Jinnah Hospital Quetta and Khuzdar, Chaman, Turbat and Fort Saifullah's teaching hospitals as well as district headquarters hospitals.\"}]",
         "The situation in Kalat suggests an IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) classification. The destruction of crops due to monsoon rains and floods has significantly impacted food availability. Disruption in food supply routes and high prices of essentials like LPG indicate severe access issues. Economic disruptions, strikes, and protests further strain livelihoods, highlighting reliance on negative coping mechanisms.\n\nWeather data shows an absence of significant precipitation to support recovery, suggesting prolonged stress on agriculture and water resources. Moreover, reports of temporary migration due to harsh winter conditions and compounded by security concerns reflect the complexity of the crisis.\n\nOverall, the combination of environmental shocks, economic hardships, and inadequate coping capacities align with the characteristics of an IPC Phase 3 scenario.",

The Wild Polio Virus (WPV One) has been found in environmental samples of Khuzdar and earlier in seven districts, which has left the total number of districts affected by the virus. According to the Regional Reference Laboratory of the National Institute of Health (NIH), new cases of polio have been reported in the Union Council of Jhil Magsi, where a 3 -year -old child was infected with the virus and a half -year -old child was also affected by the virus in Fort Abdullah's Union Council.

He said that six cases of polio were reported last year but this year the number has been almost doubled, though the year is still 5 months. He said that the situation was ideal in 2021 when only one case of polio was reported and the virus was limited to some tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but due to some unintentional decisions, polio has begun to spread again and now the virus has spread all over the country. Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath, Coordinator of the National Health Services, said that polio destroyed the future of two more Pakistani children, and they have become paralyzed for a lifetime. The Prime Minister's Focal Person for Anti -Polio Aisha Raza Farooq said that this year the virus has been found in more than 50 districts, especially in Balochistan, the virus is spreading rapidly, where 9 cases have been reported in six districts of the province.

So writers should sympathize with the relatives of the unidentified persons, and raise their voice in their favor. Whenever a person is known, his family dies, if they know that their loved ones is no longer in this world, then they may be declared in this world. At every sigh, it is thought that their lads have not knocked on, their eyes are stoning to hear their voices, the ears are fortunate to hear their voices, they are fortunate to meet their loved ones, but it is not possible for them to wait. But this matter is not so simple because if it was so simple then there would be no confusion! During the last one month, the banned outfit of Balochistan killed at least 18 Punjabis in various operations. , So they were taken off the bus and was shot dead. On April 28, two people were shot dead in Turbat, both were Punjabi. On May 9, some armed men entered the residential quarters of Gwadar and killed seven Punjabis. Events are not new, even before this, Punjabis have been killed on the basis of their identity cards in Balochistan. The fact is that I should express their unity to the Baloch people or read these innocent poor Punjabis, or do both work together with their young people. One is with the Balochistan cause, the other is fiercely opposed to Baloch resistance and the third is somewhat neutral. The gentleman about the Baloch protesters has strongly criticized my views and said that if you do not want to kill the missing persons in the past, it was not possible to kill them. Those who are \\\"resisting\\\" themselves, hope that their movement will be pure and free from all sorts, is not fair. More argued that the young man gave the same kind of abuses on the other side, so one -sided condemnation is not true and that he does not know the words of the people. After hearing my words, he said in Punjabi, \\\"Hun Rest O!\\\" This meant that I already used to tell you that these people are not worthy of sympathy, but you have a fever of human rights and the constitution and the law, hopefully the poor and the poor. The third meeting was with the intellectual who has a logical analysis of Balochistan, he told me that after the killing of the Punjabis, he has seen various Facebook groups from Balochistan. I am writing this column in the 'Comfort Zone', I have full sympathy for the deprivation of Balochistan, I also think that no justification can be given on the issue of the unlucky people and that the killing of Punjabis cannot be defended. If the writers were continuously, they were unaware of Balochistan. But both of these things cannot be justified. I have gone to Balochistan only once in my life and I am deeply keen to go there again and travel to all the remote and deserted highways that are visible only in the movies. There will be no population and no place where there is no place. But maybe my desire can never be fulfilled, not because I cannot go to Balochistan, but because of the poverty and other problems of Balochistan, the service area and petrol pumps are not viable and beneficial to the companies. I want to seek the problem of Balochistan, and we do not want to know what to do with this problem, and we think it is a matter of concern. There will be a rash that can show the other side of the picture. It is very important to see this other side.\"}, {\"title\": \"Jafar Express tragedy: Pakistan Railway announces suspending train service for Balochistan\", \"date\": \"2025-03-12\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"terrorism, displaced\", \"content\": \"After the terrorist attack on Jaffar Express, the service of the trains to Balochistan has been suspended.

The restoration of militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan has raised concerns among security agencies and policy makers. This growing wave of terrorism is being linked to various factors, including the reorganization of military organizations, external intervention and internal instability. Various terrorist groups, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch separatists and IS-Kharsan (IS-KP), are active in planning attacks across the country. During the last year, terrorist incidents in Pakistan have seen a alarming increase, including security forces, civilians and attacks targeting infrastructure. According to intelligence agencies reports, suicide attacks, improvised bombings, and armed attacks have increased significantly in the border areas, especially in the border areas. In recent months, several high -profile attacks have highlighted the seriousness of the situation. In January 2024, a suicide bombing in Peshawar targeted more than 100 people, targeting a mosque in a high security police compound. Similarly, militants in Balochistan attacked security convoys and energy installations. The invaders have specialized in spreading fear and recruiting new members through modern weapons, drones and cyber propaganda. The Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, remains the most dangerous military organization in the country. Following the withdrawal of military operations such as Zarb -e -Azb and Riddalifsad, the group managed to reorganize Afghanistan after taking over the Afghan Taliban in August 2021. Despite the assurances of the Afghan Taliban that they will not allow their land to be used against Pakistan, the TTP has continued cross -border attacks. The group has a long history of targeting security forces, government installations and civilians, and recent attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and tribal districts are evidence of its restoration. The TTP's return has been reinforced by the release of its prisoners, the ideological support of the hard -working elements, and external financing. Balochistan militant groups, such as Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), have intensified their activities against the Pakistani state. These groups claim to fight for the independence of Balochistan and have targeted China-Pakistan Economic Transit (CPEC), security forces and local officials. In a deadly attack in February 2024, Baloch militants targeted a security checkpoint in Gwadar, located at a key location in C -Pack. Pakistan has been of the view that India's intelligence agency \\\"RA\\\" is destabilizing the region by backing these groups. ISIS-KHsan (IS-KP), which is a regional branch of ISIS, has also increased its presence in Pakistan. The group has carried out terrorism and deadly bombings on the basis of religious differences. IS-KP works separately from the Afghan Taliban and has often targeted them. According to Pakistan's intelligence agencies, India is promoting terrorism through Baloch separatists and TTP factions. Intelligence agencies have provided evidence of India's support for Baloch separatists and TTP. The arrest of Indian spy Kulbhushan Yadav in 2016 reinforced Pakistan's claims that India was involved in destructive activities. Some analysts say that world powers are protecting their strategic interests by keeping Pakistan unstable. The enemy can use Pakistan as a buffer against China's growing influence by weakening Pakistan, especially in the context of the C -Pack project. In addition, intelligence reports have shown that some Western agencies have indirectly supported militant groups for geopolitical benefits. Meanwhile, Pakistan has intensified its counter -terrorism operations to tackle the increasing threat of terrorism. The army has launched several operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to eliminate the militants. The growing wave of terrorism in Pakistan is a serious national security issue that requires a comprehensive strategy. As long as the militants are active in the TTP, Baloch separatists and ISIS-Kharsan, their operations will continue to be more complicated by external support and unsafe borders.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan's 'killer' highways\", \"date\": \"2025-03-05\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, transport bottleneck, politically engineered, lack of roads, infrastructure damage\", \"content\": \"\\\"Is this route safe?\\\" After 15 years, Muhammad Ahmed, who traveled from Quetta to Dera Ismail Khan, asked the bus driver. The news that has surfaced in the past few months has left him worried. Drivers Nawaz, who has spent the years on the streets of Balochistan, hesitated a little before responding and responded deliberately, 'The journey towards Dera Ismail Khan in the day is safe from night. In the present case, no highway in the province can be declared completely safe. ' The streets of Balochistan, which were known for their dangerous turning point, have now turned into a dangerous path for passengers like Ahmed. On February 19, seven passengers who were traveling to Punjab were killed on Barkhan-Dera Ghazi Khan Highway. The passengers were going to Lahore who were taken off the bus and their identity cards were checked and they were shot and killed. This is not the first of its kind. In fact, in recent days, numerous incidents have been reported in Balochistan where the buses going to Punjab were targeted by extremists. The worst situation has adversely affected public transport in the province. Increasing militancy, lawlessness, especially the targeted killings of travelers from Punjab, have created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. But the only fear of the people is not violent conditions, but robberies and imports on these highways are also becoming increasingly common, which poses a threat to those traveling through these routes, while locals are suffering from employment problems. In the first two months of 2025, Bashir Zeb faction of Baloch separatist groups, especially the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), blocked the passenger identity cards for hours by blocking the three major highways of the province on four different occasions. However, it is likely that the series will continue. On March 2, a group of Baloch rebel organizations Baloch Raji Ajui Sangar (Bras) launched a plan to \\\"intensify the blockade of all major highways of Balochistan to affect the logistics, economic and military interests of the state\\\". Last month, extremists blocked various locations of the Quetta-Sukkur N-65 highway in the mountainous region of Bolan, during which they won three rifles from the security team of the Provincial Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Liaquat Lahiri. Liaquat Lahiri was returning from Sibi to the provincial capital Quetta. Just one day after the incident, a convoy of trucks carrying Blaster copper from the Sendak project was hit by a militant attack in Mangochar area of \\u200b\\u200bQalat district. Earlier, on January 31, Quetta was blocked by militants belonging to banned BLA in the Mangar area of \\u200b\\u200bQalat on RCD Highway (N-25) connecting Quetta to Karachi, killing 18 security personnel. Due to accidents and deaths on this road, it has now become a 'killer highway'. On the other hand, in August last year, the BLA took action and killed 40 passengers after checking the identity card in Musa Khel district, which was the worst incident in the region in recent years. It was the second incident in 2024. In April 2024, nine passengers were killed by a bus near Noshki city of Balochistan and was killed by gunmen. The bus driver Nawaz told Dawn.com that last month, Durband, known as the area of \\u200b\\u200bthe locals, was encountered between Dera Ismail Khan and Sherani of Balochistan. \\\"I was already aware of the place, so I turned my bus to the security post, but security personnel told us that we should find another way,\\\" he said. Among the growing militancy and the growing sanctions of the state, the Baloch people are in a sense of alienation where they are struggling to achieve human, political and economic rights. The only way for them to raise their voice is protest. However, these protesters usually travel from highways, which affects traffic traffic to the main highways. According to Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind, the National Highway has been closed 76 times for various reasons since January 1. The worst traffic jam on the Quetta-Chaman highway due to the demonstration-Talking to Dawn.com, Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said, \\\"The mobs block national highways and blame the government for forced disappearances.\\\" He added that action will be taken against the concerned deputy commissioners for displaying any disqualification in reopening the roads. Zahid Baloch, a driver from Kech District in Yusuf Goth, Karachi, has seen a lot of restrictions and blockade. He said, \\\"Most passengers from Makran strip go to Karachi for treatment, though it is as far as Quetta, but people are more familiar with Karachi.\\\" But now most of the roads are closed due to protests. ' KARACHI-Quetta highway is one of the most affected roads, which is the most important transportation highway for the people of Balochistan, while many of the affected people include the same highway for medical treatment, business and travel abroad. However, in the last two months, the route has been closed due to security risks, blockade and demonstrations that have banned thousands of passengers. Vehicles are trapped in the jam on the single -carriageway of the Quetta Chaman highway - Tour: Zainuddin Ahmed, a journalist based in Quetta, says, \\\"My son had an appointment at a hospital in Karachi but I had to cancel the appointment three times due to the closure of the highway.\\\" Whenever I reiterate the journey, a new security risk arises or the demonstration begins, making it impossible for me to travel. ' Like Zainuddin Ahmed, thousands of people of Balochistan prefer road travel by road to come or leave the province due to lack of cheap alternatives. According to businessman Javed Achakzai, the ticket from Karachi to Quetta has reached 18,000 to 60 thousand recent days as road travel is being increased due to road closures. The uncertainty caused by militant activities, extortion and prolonged security checking has left transporters and drivers in distress, while businessmen are forced to close their businesses. Those who continue to work are receiving threats. Nevertheless, many transport companies have either reduced their services or are refusing to travel through dangerous routes. All these factors are severely affecting the transport of citizens. According to Balochistan Transport Union spokesman Nasir Shahwani, people are now reluctant to travel. Earlier, 200 passenger buses were active from Balochistan to Karachi, but now the number has been reduced to 100, which is a major blow to the province's transport sector. Similarly, the delivery of vegetables, fruits and other products is also affected. Nasir Shahwani says that \\\"many transporters borrow for vehicles, but now it is difficult for them to pay bank installments in the current situation.\\\" The child stands at the bus stop - Physician: Driving on the poor and single -lane highways of Balochistan is already a tiring profession, which also gets less wages. Mahmud Akhtar, 50, is in charge of the busy Musa Colony bus stop in Quetta. He was disabled with his right leg in an accident at the age of 20. They do their job every day by lame between buses and coaches. Six months ago, Mahmud lost his son Maqsood in a road accident on Quetta-Sakhar Single Lane Highway. The destination was a van conductor. The troubled father tells Dawn.com, \\\"Because of poverty, we are doing this job that is now taking our lives.\\\" Waiting for his shift at Mahmood Akhtar Bus Stop - Photo: Truck driver Madath Somali, a coal delivery from Writer Mach to Punjab, also agrees. \\\"This is not a respected job,\\\" he said. He added that transport was an important source of income for the business, police, hotel business, vehicle industries and daily wages. Despite the importance of the good transport system, the condition of Balochistan's highways is always worse. In his book 'A Cry for Justice', economist Caesar Bengali highlights how the basic infrastructure of the roads is lacking in some parts of Kharan, Wasak, Awaran and Catch. Bulchistan province, spread over an area of \\u200b\\u200b3 million 47,000 square kilometers, lacks bilateral roads, which has made the journey slow and dangerous. According to a recent report by the Medical Emergency Response Center 1122, in January 2025, 1,831 road accidents were reported in the province, killing 39 people and injuring 2,409. These accidents occurred in other areas including Mastung, Kalat, Lasbela, Chaman, Fort Saifullah, Zhob, Sibi, Loralai, Jaffarabad, Kech, Panjgur and Khuzdar. Driver traveling from Karachi to Quetta - Chase: Writer MERC data added that between October 2019 and January 2025, 80 % of road accidents on Balochistan's highways were hit by motorcyclists. Riaz Raisani, director of the Response Center, pointed out that both the driver and the passenger did not follow the safety measures. He explained that most motorcyclists do not wear helmets and protective gloves on highways. Similarly, the smaller vehicles did not set the seat belt. He added that there is no lighting and dangerous turns at night are among the reasons for road accidents. Despite the numerous promises of the provincial government, progress in improving roads is very slow. Legal efforts have been made to ensure timely construction of the highways, but large parts are still incomplete. Advocate Divine Bakhsh Mengal, who filed a petition for the delay in the completion of the Chaman-Quetta-Karachi Highway Double Carridge Way, took the stand that the government had allocated Rs 19 billion for the National Highway Authority for the route but the NHA failed to use the money. Subsequently, a petition was filed in the Balochistan High Court which, after several hearings, ordered the NHA to justify the use of less money and immediately start construction. \\\"There has been some progress after that, but a large part of the project has not yet been completed,\\\" Dawn.com. Due to the government's lack of interest and lack of measures, the highways of Balochistan have turned into dangerous areas where passengers, transporters and security personnel are at risk of life. Militants, robbers and frequent demonstrations disrupt the journey, while the province's transport sector is on the brink of destruction. Improved safety measures, basic infrastructure improvement and the urgent need for government intervention cannot be ignored. Unless these issues are resolved, the death journey will continue for those who pass by the Balochistan roads.

They were being shot at them from all sides, but they did not look back. \\\"We traveled for 4 hours on foot and then we arrived at the Frontier Corps (FC) post where we were stopped,\\\" Naaman said. On March 11, the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists attacked the Jaffar Express near Mashkaf Tunnel, about 157 km from Quetta, and took around 440 passengers. It was the first of its kind of hijacking. Earlier, the terrorists have bombed the train tracks and have tried to remove the trains from the tracks, but they have never tried to host the entire train and the riders. In response, the army launched an operation to release the hostages, which ended last night. The media wing released by the army's media wing said that all the hostages have been released while 33 terrorists involved in the attack have been killed. According to Lieutenant Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry, Director General of the Pakistan Army Department of Public Relations (ISPR), the commanders of the Army, Air Force, FC and Special Service Group participated in the operation. He said that 21 passengers and 4 FC personnel were martyred in this clearance operation. Mohammad Noman is among the lucky passengers who have not been harmed in this hijacking. But many of his friends were not as lucky as him. \\\"We have been working in Afghanistan for the past few months and we decided to go to our home (Gujranwala and Lahore) for a few weeks,\\\" he told Dawn.com.

However, the safety and security of Chinese workers and engineers working on C -Pack projects in Pakistan has become a serious problem as they are facing terrorist attacks by Baloch separatists and their militant groups, especially the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan. Therefore, dealing with the security threats posed by Chinese people to Pakistan on an emergency basis is the most important need of the time to ensure the friendly relations of the two neighbors by making the C -pack successful. The C -Pack project to invest $ 62 billion is expected to increase job opportunities for Pakistanis, help improve infrastructure and promote regional integration, which will improve the Pakistani economy. But at the moment, this most important project is facing serious security challenges. Terrorist groups, especially the Baloch Liberation Army or BLA, have begun targeting Chinese citizens working on C -Pack projects in Pakistan. The high -profile terrorist attacks from Karachi to Gwadar have exposed promises by Pakistani authorities to provide Chinese residents' safest environment. The Baloch Liberation Army has already demanded China to stop work on the pack and leave Balochistan immediately. The Baloch separatist group has repeatedly warned Beijing on a more pack agreement with Islamabad, and has also condemned the Chinese role in the Gwadar port project. These attacks further increase security concerns for Beijing, which is currently the largest foreign investor country in Pakistan. Pakistan, on the other hand, has taken a stand on \\\"foreign elements\\\" accusing Chinese citizens of terrorist attacks that their main purpose is to harm Pak -China relations and C -Pack projects. The terrorist attacks on Chinese people in Pakistan have not only lost valuable lives, but they have also shaken the confidence of Chinese investors who are now demanding foolproof security. It is also hot that China was not so excited to advance the new schemes of SeaPeak. Some media reports even claimed that during the recent visit of the Pakistani Prime Minister to China, there was no significant progress in particular regarding the C -Pack file. But after the visit, official statements issued by the two countries did not give any impression. In a meeting with Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, President Xi Jinping expressed the hope that Pakistan would create a \\\"secure and stable business environment\\\" that would guarantee the safety of \\\"Chinese\\\" personnel and plans. On the other hand, a senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official has said that the terrorist activities targeting Chinese workers involved in the C -Pack projects are part of a widespread conspiracy against the C -Pack. During a meeting with a delegation of Pakistani journalists in Beijing, Shen Wei, deputy director of the Asian Affairs Department, reiterated that the ideal friendship between China and Pakistan would thwart the blatant ambitions of conspirators against the C -Pack project. He said that the Pakistani government leadership has assured the Chinese leadership that those responsible for these operations will face severe accountability and that their networks will be ensured. The Chinese official strongly dismissed the impression that China or Pakistan were considering restricting or withdrawing the scope of the C -Pack projects. However, Pakistani security officials say that strict measures are being taken under a comprehensive policy to eliminate terrorists involved in terrorist incidents against Chinese citizens. Intelligence sharing with Chinese authorities is also underway in this regard. Pakistani security officials say that not only the Baloch militants or the TTP involved in the terrorist incidents against Chinese people, but also a group of establishing a separate state in Xinjiang, China's Muslim -majority province, is participating. It is said that hundreds of Chinese militants belonging to the East Turkestan Islamic Movement came to North Waziristan in the late 90s, where they have a deep connection with the Taliban elements, which is still in place. On the basis of this relationship, Baloch militants and Taliban elements, along with these Muslim militants, plan to attack Chinese people working on C -Pack projects in Pakistan. Pakistani authorities say they have arrested several militants belonging to the East Turkistan Islamic Movement in the past and handed them over to China. But on the other hand, it is also a bitter fact that attacks on Chinese citizens in Pakistan have not stopped, so it is important to take vigorous steps to root out the network of terrorists involved in the attacks so that both Pak -China relations and the C -Pack project can be saved.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan: Baloch Solidarity Committee rally in Dalbuddin, mobile services affected\", \"date\": \"2025-01-25\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"human rights abuses\", \"content\": \"The Baloch Solidarity Committee organized a large gathering in Dalbuddin area of \\u200b\\u200bBalochistan, while mobile services were reported in the area.

India's involvement in terrorism in Balochistan is not a hidden thing. 193 people were killed in bomb blasts in passenger trains in Madrid. On July 7, 2005, a London underground train was targeted, killing 52 people. March 29, 2010 Kumasko train was attacked, 40 people were killed in the blasts. On March 1, 2014, 31 people were killed in a Chinese city. On April 3, 2017, the Metro train was exploded in St. Petersburg, killing 15 people. Train means a refuge in motion, a place where the tired passenger surrenders in front of the steel silence on the tracks, with the belief that the journey ends with a safe arrival. Mixes calves. Therefore, it can be understood that the attack on the train is attacked. There is action against the processing process. Of course, the government has killed 33 terrorists with a successful operation. About 300 passengers were released, but all the details of it could not reach the public yet. I think the fine detail of terrorist incidents should also be told to people so that they can know the horror of their enemies. They look at the horrific face of the enemy elements and support their forces wholeheartedly. In order to stop terrorism in Balochistan, the government will have to set up its writ at all costs. He has to strictly bring the terrorists to their end, but I think it is a matter of goodwill, with a lot of love in this war. Will be Sustainable and permanent peace is not possible only through military operations. It also needs a light of justice, equality and development. When poverty is eliminated, when good education will reach every doorstep, when the highways of employment are opened, the lamps of hope will be lit in the tight streets of hatred. Terrorism can be fought not only with weapons but with a fair distribution of love, dialogue and dialogue. Balochistan should be given the same honor, facilities and opportunities that have the right of any prosperous region, so that the darkness of deprivation can be avoided automatically and the land of extremism becomes barren. This war should be fought not only on the borders, but also in the minds, because when dreams are secure, there will be no weapons, books and tools will be held.\"}, {\"title\": \"Allama Iqbal, Bhutto and foreign pressure\", \"date\": \"2025-04-07\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, terrorism, displaced, food insecurity\", \"content\": \"April is the month of the death of two prominent figures in the country. Poet Dr. Allama Muhammad Iqbal 21 and former Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto left this world on April 4, Allama Iqbal was a revolutionary poet and distant politician, so it seems that the nation should not realize that the world does not have any life in this world, when it does not create a new world in this world. Do not move to conscience. \\u201d Pakistan came into existence with the tireless efforts of Allama Iqbal and Quaid -e -Azam. If you look at the history, we have periods of concessions and sarcasm, on the other hand, the hot market of corruption and looting, which has brought us to the place that we are in front of the world at this point. The country is waiting for individuals these days whose body can get the energy of the nation. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was the founder of Pakistan's atomic bomb program. With his efforts, Pakistan has become the seventh nuclear power in the world today, but due to the low economy, we are suffering from external pressure, which is not free from our state, our United States, and our United States, and our United States, and our United States. Billions of politicians, bureaucrats, retired officers, trillions of trillions are out of the country, but it is surprising that even in the most difficult period of the country's history, no one has made progress and offers to return their wealth. External debt is being relied upon to run the country, young people are guaranteed to scrutinize Diyarbakir in uncertainty, and in any country its religious and national festivals are given relief by the government and the traders, but in our country, the people of our country are happy with the holy month of Ramadan. Our failure is a testimony to the failure. On the other hand, the common man's life has become difficult due to economic misery, terrorism has been raised once again, Balochistan is sluggish. That is, the situation in Balochistan is very serious, it is probably not aware of the people of other provinces. Those who know the situation, they can well guess at which point Balochistan is at this time. Balochistan is not only a provincial but in the national framework. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been facing terrorism and unrest for more than four decades. Perhaps there is a family whose homes have not come out of funerals. After the Taliban occupation of Afghanistan for the past two years, the situation has worsened, today, the state has come to the fore to establish a process. The Tehreek -e -Insaf's government is invading the state and the federal government by making the province a front. The country needs one -dimensional at this time, PTI will have to realize its responsibility in this situation, the negotiating table will have to come, all political parties should unite for the country and the nation. The global situation is also strained, the color of Gaza and Palestine has changed. Yes, Yemen, Lebanon are also trapped in war, Iraq is also overwhelmed, Afghanistan and India are openly enmity with Pakistan, Donald Trump's policies are not good for Muslims. Foreign policy has to be changed, all kinds of foreign pressures have to be overcome, then we can live up to move forward.\"}, {\"title\": \"Civil Society calls for an immediate solution to human rights crises\", \"date\": \"2025-03-27\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"repression, economic crisis, rising inflation, food insecurity\", \"content\": \"Pakistan's Human Rights Commission (HRCP) and other civil society groups have called on the government to immediately resolve the current 'human rights crises', including crackdowns on protesters and blasphemy and misuse of cybercrime laws. This demand comes between the recent crackdown on the Baloch Solidarity Committee (BYC) protesters, who were protesting against the forced disappearances and arrests of their leaders in Karachi and Quetta, as well as targeting journalists to the prevention of Electronic Crime Act and other cases of human rights. According to a press release issued after the media talk, HRCP and other civil society and rights groups held a press conference at the Karachi Press Club to focus on these issues and demanded the federal and provincial governments to resolve the rights of the country immediately. The press release states that the increasing state dictatorship, suppressing disagreement by force, restrictions on the freedom of the press and the increasing influence of the establishment on governance has led to widespread dissatisfaction. It added that the short -term disappearance of journalists and rights activists is now an important cause of concern. The press release added that the alleged role of the establishment in politics has 'gained a lot of influence on the expense of democratic rule', while the allegations of political interference in the judiciary have also turned public confidence in the legal system. HRCP and Civil Society added that religious extremism is being used as a weapon against backward groups, especially in Punjab against the Ahmadi community. Due to the growing influence of militants in Pakistan's border areas, especially Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, ordinary people have been in danger of violence and extortion, which has created an atmosphere of constant fear. The press release further states that in Balochistan, what began as a 'basic rights struggle', is now being labeled by the state. Instead of launching political talks with stakeholders in the province, authorities have continued to use irreparable force against the protesters, and widespread arrests are being made. In the meantime, militant groups have begun targeting civilians, in the meantime, the joint statement said. In Sindh, protests against the construction of controversial canals on the Indus River have intensified, as any such move will be directly attacking the environmental rights of the people. The statement added that both the federal government and the political opposition have failed to reach the \\\"consensus of the need for the need\\\" on the future of the country and the role of the parliament has diminished, and the laws have been passed 'in a hurry and without consideration'. The joint statement of the HRCP and the civil society further indicated that continuous inflation, unemployment and violations of workers' rights continue as the minimum wage laws are not being implemented, pensioners are being deprived of their liabilities and both public and private sectors are delayed. HRCP and civil society groups jointly called for a political solution to the Balochistan crisis, which included the end of forced disappearances and the unconditional release of all detained after the recent protests. He also called for the 'cruel laws', including Paca, to abolish and withdraw policies that ban civil liberties. In its other demands, the groups said that the construction of canals on the Indus River should be closed immediately and instead there should be a transparent policy of water use that reflects the will of the people, the occupation of land for commercial purposes in the guise of agricultural development should be eliminated and the land of the land in Sindh and other areas. During the press conference, HRCP Chairman Asad Iqbal Butt also raised the issue of minimum wage and blamed inflation for the lack of law and order in the country. Zebest University's Dean of Arts Riaz Sheikh expressed deep concern over Balochistan's universities to allegedly organizing anti -militant demonstrations after the Jaffar Express attack, saying such repression would give rise to hatred and resentment among students. Meanwhile, Nasir Mansoor, general secretary of the National Trade Union Federation, said that a 'red line' has been crossed in response to Baloch protesters and women in response to their 'use of their rights of gathering and freedom of speech. Nasir Mansoor condemned such a use of cybercrime law, saying, \\\"If a journalist refers to it, the Packa Act will be implemented.\\\" He said that whenever people try to take a democratic route, you send people from the police and agencies to deal with them and other demonstrators, which do not apply to Section 144. He called on the authorities to learn from the devastating consequences of Bangladesh of 1971. Member of the Women's Action Forum, Mehnaz Rehman, endorsed Mansoor's sentiments and said that the PACA law had 'taken away the freedom of expression from the people. \\u201dThe chairman of the Sindh Front, Khaliq Junejo, also agreed with Nasir Mansoor and pointed out how the BYC protesters were apparently supported by the protests. He termed Sindh as 'colonial', citing the custom application of Section 144. Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed also criticized the country's blasphemy and cybercrime laws for weapons and warned that the country was approaching a 'destroyed' situation. He said how the government can solve many of the country's problems by 'strategy' by not opening several anti -fronts simultaneously.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan\", \"date\": \"2024-11-21\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, humanitarian situation\", \"content\": \"Very few politicians in Pakistan are concerned with literature, most politicians come to Parliament with the help of extremely non -literary powers. After the success of his old politics, he becomes a teacher of history and wants his will only to be understood as true. Former Balochistan Chief Minister Dr Abdul Malik Baloch is one of the few politicians who is associated with literature with a student. Some time ago, a collection of his legends in Baluchi was published under the name \\\"Paradiseabad\\\" which was translated by Abdul Halim Hayatan into Urdu. A few days ago, Dr. Sahib presented the gift of his book to me Nachis and said that he was writing a book on the history of Balochistan. This book is in the final stages of completion. It is good that before the completion of this book, the government of Pakistan has decided another military operation in Balochistan. Since 1947, there have been several military operations in Balochistan. As a result of an operation, peace was not established. Let's see what the operation has been announced in 2024. Dr. Abdul Malik Baloch's book will be very important in the sense that the history he is in his book has been a role in this history. In his youth, he took up arms for the independence of Balochistan. The war against the state came and then came a time when he was negotiating with those who fought against the state as Chief Minister Balochistan. Why did these talks not succeed and where do the doctor stand today? Everyone knows the answer to these questions. Two photos are the answer to every question on the Balochistan issue. In the first picture, Nawab Akbar Bugti is welcoming Quaid -e -Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah in his youth. Bugti Sahib not only participated in the Tehreek -e -Taliban Pakistan but also voted in favor of Pakistan in the royal jirga. Later, he became the Home Minister in the government of Malik Feroz Khan Noon, which included Gwadar in Pakistan. A few weeks after the achievement of the feat, Bugti Sahib was taken to jail on the orders of General Ayub Khan. Leaving jail, he became governor, sometimes the chief minister. He tried hard to walk with the federal Pakistan, but General Pervez Musharraf brought him to the mountains and in 2006 he was made the \\\"martyred Balochistan\\\" of the angry Balochs of the federal Baloch. The second picture is Nawab Nawroz Khan Zarkzai. In this picture, Mir Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo and Sardar Attaullah Mengal are seen with them. All of them are being taken to police custody. Nawab Nawroz Khan started resistance against General Ayub Khan's martial law in 1958. They were removed from the mountains with the Qur'an and was taken to jail instead of negotiations. In 1964, the seventh -year -old elder died in Kohlo Jail. Later, Mir Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo became the governor of Balochistan and Attaullah Mengal became the Chief Minister. Both made Urdu the official language of the province and approved a resolution from the Provincial Assembly to end the Sardar system, but the government was not allowed to complete a year. Later, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto acknowledged in his book \\\"Rumors and Reality\\\" that what he did against the Mengal government was the result of pressure from military generals. On August 2, 1974, Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto threw a hand grenade by a young man named Majid Lango in Quetta. Bhutto survived Majid Lango was killed. Today, a group called Majid Brigade in Balochistan is conducting suicide attacks. The group named its name in the name of Majid Lango, which was killed in 1974. These militants are happy with the announcement of a new military operation in 2024 as they will now receive a new manpower and get more external assistance. On the other hand, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti is also happy. The Balochistan dispute made him the Home Minister and the Chief Minister. If the dispute increases, both the Sarfraz Bugti and the Majid Brigade will benefit more. The history of military operations in Balochistan is very old. The first major military operation in the past was carried out in 1916 by the British Army General Dyer. The same director ordered firing in Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar in 1919. General Dyer's book \\\"Balochistan border raids\\\" states that the Baloch tribes in the First World War were organizing resistance to the British with the help of the German government, so General Dyer conducted a military operation on the border of British Balochistan and Iranian Balochistan to end this resistance. The second major operation took place in 1948 against the Khan of Kalat's brother Prince Karim. On November 13, 2024, Sohail Warraich Sahib wrote in his column quoting Sarfraz Bugti as saying that it was a small incident against which a military operation was not a police operation. If Sohail Warraich read General Mohammad Akbar Khan's book \\\"My Last Destination\\\", he will find that in June 1948, General Akbar Khan organized an operation against Prince Abdul Karim. On page 283 of the book, it is reported that Colonel Gulzar was sent to Qalat and Colonel Shah. In this case, Akbar Bugti cooperated with the government. The book contains clear indications that some British army officers and the Indian government were interfering in Pakistan by the way to Afghanistan, but with the efforts of the Khan of Kalat, the rebellion did not move forward. In order to understand the uprising of Nawab Nawroz Khan, the role of Alexander Mirza has to be understood, which encouraged the Khan of Qalat Mir Ahmad Yar on its own so that martial law can be imposed in Pakistan. Khan of Kalat's book Inside Baluchistan is now extinct because this book was banned. It is hoped that Dr Abdul Malik Baloch's upcoming book will take a neutral review of the role of Pakistan in Balochistan. The solution to the problems of the people of Balochistan is neither an independent Balochistan nor is there a moody and slave politics. Three countries will have to be broken to create an independent Balochistan. Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran. It's very difficult. The Baloch needs to give the rights that Quaid -e -Azam promised. The solution to the problem is clear and transparent elections in Balochistan and this solution is not currently possible.\"}, {\"title\": \"Terrorist incidents and casualties decreased, security report\", \"date\": \"2024-07-02\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"terrorism, conflict\", \"content\": \"ISLAMABAD (Tahir Khalil) Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies has claimed that several months later, terrorist incidents and casualties have decreased in the country, 31 militants were killed in security forces operations, 27 were arrested.

According to the National EOC, three new polio cases have been reported in the country and this year their total number has reached twenty -one. These polio cases have surfaced from Balochistan, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A nine -month -old girl was left in Mohmand district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while a year and a half in Abdullah district of Balochistan and a three -and -a -half -year -old child in Kemari district of Karachi have been affected by polio. Twenty -one cases have been recorded so far this year and last year, the number of cases was only six, which has now increased three more cases. It is a bitter fact that Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where polio disease is still present despite effective vaccination, and the UN agency is less than nineteen in the year. A decade ago in the homeland, polio cases were reported, but the world has expressed deep concern over polio attacks in Pakistan fifteen years ago, taking steps to help patriotism in anti -polio measures, and Pakistan has been able to make polio -free country. And people hide their children as they come to the polio teams area. Now after two decades, we look back, then the situation is the same as it was. Even today, polio prevention teams are assassinated and polio workers, including women, are particularly targeted, with police personnel and law enforcement personnel who are not able to save their lives. Directives to immediately suspend the polio coordinator. Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ali Amin Gandapur also issued strict notice and issued an order to investigate the matter and said that all other responsibilities should be determined along with poor polio campaign in Mohmand district, but the concerned government officials as well as the partners' staff should be taken against the same. I will not compromise on the standard of the polio campaign and now the authorities should reform themselves or be ready for punishment. He also announced the treatment of the affected girl and the provincial government. It has also happened in Pakistan for the first time that a chief minister has decided to support a polio victim, otherwise there has not been any such thing that has come out, not expressing sympathy with the victims of polio and they do not make the disability their power for a lifetime, mostly begging or thinking. If a brief review, it is a sad fact that many valuable lives have been lost in the attacks on polio teams in Pakistan so far, but the consciousness that should have been born in the public has not been unfortunately, in fact, the concerns of polio medicine have not been reported. First of all, there is no standard in the medical field of research in the homeland and if any research is being done somewhere, the standard will be such that the world will not recognize it, there is no shortage of essence but the double standard of the West is that a Pakistani who does not have any medicine in the United States and Europe's laboratory. The rest of the polio -prevention drops are air and air, they have nothing to do with ground realities, but it is true that the scholars have not had an impact on the public because if so, many children would not have avoided polio and polio teams would not have been attacking polio.

Speaking at a press conference with Chief Minister Balochistan Sarfraz Bugti regarding the attack on Jaffar Express in Islamabad, spokesman Pak Army Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif said that the terrorists took action in a systematic manner, the Jaffar Express incident took place in a very difficult area, where a large number of terrorists were attacked. He said that the terrorists blew up the railway track with the help of IEDs and distributed passengers from the train and distributed it into groups, fake videos were made from the AI \\u200b\\u200bof train incident on social media, Indian media continued to propagate through fake AI videos. Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif said that efforts were made to make a statement against Pakistan through fake videos, Indian media tried to destroy the country's identity with false videos. The spokesman added that the terrorists left a group of hostages on the night of March 11 on a linguistic basis, which had some logistic reasons because so many people could not be controlled, secondly, they had to give themselves the impression of being a humanitarian friend. He said that the terrorists left some of their comrades on the train and a large number went to their hideouts in the mountains, after which the security forces targeted them and this was the first time. According to the spokesman of the Pakistan Army, the terrorists were in constant contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the entire terrorist operation, adding that on the morning of March 12, our forces targeted the terrorists through snipers. He said that on the afternoon of March 12, the Special Services Group (SSG) was killed by the operation and targeted suicide bombers between the hostages with the help of sniper.\\nExit escaped in different directions. SSG's Zarar company enters the train with a young engine - Photo: Dawn News Lieutenant General Ahmed Shahrif said that the hostage of the train managed to escape outside the train, while SSG's Zarar company's young engine entered the train via the engine. He said that the operation was done so skillfully that no innocent hostage was killed during the entire operation, the evidence that took place before the operation was started. The spokesman said that the terrorists had foreign weapons and equipment, food was provided to the passengers recovered in the operation and shifted to a safe place under the supervision of the forces, during the press conference, various stages of operation and transfer to the hostages were shown. The spokesman said that the incident was the most successful incident in the history of the train hostage in history, where despite the presence of suicide bombers at a remote location within 36 hours, the Pak Army, the Air Force and the FC completed the operation with full planning. He said that this is another incident of terrorism that links to the neighboring country of Afghanistan, it is part of the ongoing process, because the structures that come here are part of it, the suicide bombers who come here are Afghans. Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry showed pictures on the screen, saying that the recently killed foreign Badruddin was the son of the deputy governor of Baghdis, the foreign governor was a battalion commander in the Afghan army and was terrorizing Pakistan, and was still a terrorist. He added that the weapons they received from them were also brought from Afghanistan, but the main sponsor of the incidents that took place in Balochistan and the incidents that took place before is the main sponsor. On this occasion, the DGISPR showed confessional video statements of Indian spy Kulbhushan Yadav, in which he said that RAW's goal and purpose is to carry out numerous terrorist acts in Balochistan. To facilitate them so that they can target specific goals, and all operations of the military -style can be carried out because the Balochistan movement is not through the sea, the purpose is to provide safe land to the Baloch nationalists and to be fully coordinated by the sea. The army, which is their internal environment, also showed the statement of the Baloch surrenders, in which they are saying that 'no war is taking place, people are killing the innocent Baloch only for their own personal interests, in all these conspiracies, especially India.' Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said that therefore, the Jafar Express incident has happened, it is a continuation of the same policy, and it was pushed there to work. \\\"We thank God and offer greetings, to the brave young men who saved innocent lives from their authority, boldness, a very dangerous situation,\\\" he said. Responding to a question, the DGISPR said that Pakistan and law enforcement agencies fight against what is around it, the whole nation has to fight against terrorism. Similarly, the previous government had given a revised National Action Plan, which had 14 points, and the 14 -point vision is involved in stability. All stakeholders agree that if they do 14 work, terrorism will end. Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry further said that there is a point in 14 points, which is related to Kinatic that no military / armed group will be allowed to operate. He said that the next point is to prevent the spread of terrorism through the media (social, print, electronic), as well as effective steps will be taken in terms of religious sectarian terrorism, while it is also the point that terror financing will be stopped, illegal spectrum will be controlled. The DGISPR said that the next point is that likewise, anti -terrorism cases will be worked out in the courts, the capacity of anti -terrorism will be enhanced, madrassas will be registered and registered. He said that one of the points, I tell me where we are in it, in 2024 law enforcement agencies conducted 59,775 intelligence -based operations, conducted 11,654 intelligence -based operations by mid -March in 2025, which means are 180 daily operations. Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif said that around 1250 terrorists have been carried out in 2024 and 2025, 563 young men have entrusted their lives to Allah in the way of protecting the people of Pakistan, so it is being done at all times, every moment. He added that one of the reasons for the rise is that terrorism is slowly getting space in Afghanistan, there are centers of temptation in Afghanistan, they have leadership there, they are being trained. The DGISPR said that when the coalition forces have been withdrawn from Afghanistan, the night vision devices are there in large numbers, which are available to these terrorist organizations, as the next reason is that we must admit that for the first time, the state of Pakistan is fighting against this illegal spectrum, which includes a large number of smuggling, smuggling and smuggling. Includes He said that it is hundreds of billion dollars of mafia, the mafia that does not want the work to end the work they are hollowing out freely, they also support terrorism. Spokesman Pak Army said that the enemies of the state who do not want Pakistan to develop their potentials, who have no ideas. Talking about the missing persons, he said that there was a commission on this issue and it has been working since 2011, whoever claims that Missing Persons are, they have the right to go to this commission. He said that the total cases reported on this commission in Balochistan are 2,911, only 452 are left. All the rest have been resolved, so the state is resolving the issue, but there are some questions from the state. You give that list, are they not a Missing Person, give a list of temptations. The DGISPR said that give a list of those who are in the training centers in Balochistan, who are those people, what is their status? In these human smuggling, your children are drowning, of them are quite missing, in Karachi every day, the hard work that comes to work on the sidewalks, many of them become dear to Allah, they have been declared as luxurious, they have been buried, hundreds but thousands of people have been buried. He said that the US, the United Kingdom and India are also missing, where in which country do they climb their forces and their institutions? He further said that if these are Missing, then thousands of people in Pakistan who have been victimized by this terror, including civilians, army personnel and policemen, do not their children miss their parents? They don't miss their martyr father? Talking to a question on intelligence failure, Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif said that intelligence needs a lot of information, because a lot is happening, if you look at the context of Balochistan, it is 44 % of the province of Pakistan, while 50 % of it consists of mountains and 20 % of the night, and 20 % of the nights are in the desert. Could He said that before there is an accident, neutralizes it, but in intelligence where you see failure, which you point out, you said it is a failure of intelligence, which I do not agree with, there are thousands of intelligence successes, which you do not know. He said that intelligence agencies are heartbroken day and night for the citizens of Pakistan, it should be careful to call intelligence failure. Responding to a question, the DGISPR said that 33 terrorists were hell in the Jaffar Express operation, the number was more of them, when they removed the people from the train and took hostage, they left a Small group here and the rest of the groups were going back to the mountains. He said that it takes a while to contact the forces but the observation starts soon, so they went ahead at a certain distance, they were going to different parties, our analysis is that a large number of them were killed, but not all were killed. He said that where the operation took place on the train, which was carried out by snipers and Zarar, there were a total of 33 hells. Responding to a question on the BLA's claim to take hostage, the DGISPR said that they did not have enough time to take a hostage to their secrets, the terrorists were going themselves, there were no hostages with them, all the hostages were present. Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif said on the question of the casualties in the attack on Jafar Express, a total of 26 passengers were martyred in the incident, 354 hostages were recovered, including 37 injured, he said that 18 martyrs belonged to the army and 5 others. He said that during the entire operation, there were 5 FC operational testimonies in which 3 FC personnel were attacked by terrorists before the train attacked the checkpoint. An FC personnel were killed in a firing on the morning of the shooting of the terrorists while the terrorists were killed in the firing of the terrorists. Has been Earlier, at the start of the press conference, Chief Minister Balochistan Sarfraz Bugti said that the security forces pay tribute to the successful operation, it is commendable for the Pak army to release the hostages. Sarfraz Bugti has said that the elements that spread the unrest will not be exempted, it has decided to treat separatists as terrorists. Balochistan Chief Minister thanks to the US, China, Russia, Britain, Iran, Turkey, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Europe, the UN Secretary and the European Ambassador for condemning the attack on Jaffar Express. Sarfraz Bugti said that in Baloch traditions, such incidents are seen in a view that has nothing to do with the Baloch traditions, the Baloch traditions are trustworthy, but the terrorists have disrupted all these traditions, so I say they should not be called Baloch. He said that just as the terrorists who have been terrorizing in the name of Islam have nothing to do with Islam, the terrorists in the name of Balochit have nothing to do with Baloch. Sarfraz Bugti said, \\\"I want to say one thing and answer that the Afghan land is being used against us, it is happening long ago, they have signed a contract with the world in Doha that their land will not be used against anyone else. It will also have to think that the world is not only for Pakistan.\\\" He was asked how much the case of the missing persons is associated with terrorism. In response to the question, the Chief Minister said that even if a person is missing, no justification can be made. He added that however, if it was used as a propaganda tool against the state, it should be condemned. If you look in the world, are there only missing persons in Pakistan? What is the number of Missing Persons in the developed countries of the world? How many people are missing in the US and the UK and then in the region? He said that this is an issue in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and elsewhere in Pakistan but why is Balochistan repeated again and again? Chief Minister Balochistan said that terrorists are not fighting on this basis, terrorism has nothing to do with backwardness, this debate is not right, their purpose is to break the country and they want to do through violence. It may be recalled that on March 11, the terrorists blew up the railway track in the Bolan Pak area, and attacked the Jaffar Express and took more than 400 passengers hostage. Although the remote area was facing difficulties, security forces conducted a major operation to save the hostages in Bolan Pass in the Dhadar area. Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry, Director General of the Pakistan Army Department of Public Relations (ISPR), said the next day that the hostages of Jaffar Express were recovered and all 33 terrorists were killed, but before the operation began, 21 terrorists killed 21 civilians.\"}]",
         "The district of Kech is facing significant challenges that point towards an IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) during the prediction period Nov-Mar,2024-2025. Here's why:\n\n1. **Infrastructure and Market Disruptions**: Flood-damaged roads have disrupted food supply chains, affecting market prices and availability, crucial for maintaining consistent food supplies.\n\n2. **Economic and Livelihood Challenges**: Economic activities are significantly hampered by militancy, security issues, and CPEC project disruptions. This affects employment and income sources, limiting household purchasing power.\n\n3. **Coping Strategies**: Residents are likely reducing meal sizes due to economic hardships, an indication of stress and potential reliance on crisis coping mechanisms.\n\n4. **Environmental Impact**: Flooding has caused infrastructural damage and livestock losses, directly impacting food availability and livelihoods.\n\n5. **Health Concerns**: The severe dengue outbreak further strains healthcare resources, adding to community vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Weather Patterns**: Precipitation is variable, with heavy rains during July and August potentially exacerbating flooding issues, while drier months may stress water and agricultural resources.\n\nTogether, these factors suggest that households will likely face food consumption gaps or will rely heavily on negative coping strategies, indicative of a Crisis phase.",

Unfortunately, Pakistan has been involved in countries that have been greatly affected by terrorism. Earlier, security agencies broke the backbone of the terrorists through Operation Zarb -e -Azb in 2009, Operation Zarb -e -Azb in 2014 through Operation Riddalifsad. We have to fully support the government and state institutions to thwart the terrorist ambitions. At present, there are about twenty terrorist organizations active in Afghanistan that are creating security issues for regional countries. There is evidence that Afghan authorities are patronizing these terrorist organizations. They want to destabilize the country by attacking civil installations and public places in Pakistan, while economic activities, especially Pak -China cooperation, are being targeted. Today, Pakistan is facing a decades ago in terms of terrorism. Terrorism in Pakistan began in 1980. Pakistan defeated the monster by offering more than a thousand lives. After the Taliban government came to Afghanistan in August 2021, the TTP and other terrorist groups were encouraged to intensify their operations in Pakistan. There should be no compromise on law and order in Balochistan. The elements involved in the incident should be brought to the role of a disbeliever so that a sense of security can be created and a strong message to the terrorists. In addition to other terrorist incidents in Dara Bolan, attacks on trains have also occurred. The security situation and the steps taken in this regard should be reviewed and a strategy should be adopted so that the trains are safe to safeguard. We must fully support our security forces, as well as the political leadership should carry the burden of our responsibilities. Ever since the Taliban government has been established in Afghanistan. Terrorist operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have increased drastically, mainly due to the Afghan government's full backing of TTP and facilitating Afghanistan, which has been handed over to the Afghan government several times. It is an open aggression that cannot be tolerated any more. In 2024, a total of 444 terrorist attacks took place in the country. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has said that terrorism has raised its head again, unless fully peace is established, the dream of development will not be a shameful interpretation. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan continue the fight against terrorism every day, police and forces of Pakistan are making sacrifices, these great sacrifices should always be remembered. The international community, including China, the US, Russia, Iran, Iran, Turkey, the European Union, the UN Secretary -General, has condemned the incident of terrorists in the Balochistan Main Train War, killing and killing innocent civilians. It is certain that terrorists have neither religion nor any belief. They only believe in bloodshed, so if they are declared an enemy of humanity, it will not be exaggerated. Their elimination is not only the responsibility of the affected countries, but the entire international community will have to unite to eliminate them.\"}, {\"title\": \"Terrorism Challenge ...?\", \"date\": \"2024-06-27\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"terrorism, politically engineered, economic crisis\", \"content\": \"Worrying\\u2026 According to Raja Akbar Dad Khan Pakistani media, when we have controlled terrorism in the country and this is a statement that every government has adopted. Last week, several soldiers lost their lives as a result of terrorism in Balochistan. Condolences were also broadcast by the President and the Prime Minister, the formal proceedings were completed. On the one hand, the country is facing political instability and violent incidents coming to the day, and on the other hand, the government has recognized such incidents as everyday life. Lack of long -term planning is not being addressed. Both facts are a cause for concern for Pakistani people and Pakistanis living in foreign countries. After all, why are we failing to overcome these difficulties, there are very serious questions that the public is not answering in a satisfactory way. Comments and announcements by the authority can only work to a certain extent to keep the morale of the public stable. The rest of the work for a stable Pakistan is the responsibility of the government and the government is suffering from thought. The recent terrorist incident requires a deep inquiry because President Asif Zardari or the province was present in the province or returned to Islamabad after completing his visit to Balochistan. Every martyrdom leaves a debt to the people of Pakistan and in the same incident of a dozen military personnel, the testimony has left another major debt to Pakistan. In the last two decades in defense of Pakistan, people from military and other institutions have put huge debt on the heads of the people and this loan can be paid only in the form of better security. This recent incident once again proves that our enemy wants to subdue Pakistan in all respects. Over the past few years, governments have implemented various security plans, some of which have been semi -successful and some failed. The National Action Plan was a security plan that was implemented, but soon the plan was removed from the eyes of the people. By creating consensus on national security and economic stability plans, we can see the dream of a stable Pakistan is fulfilled. The incident, which took place around President Zardari's visit, is also hiding the message that our enemy can attack us wherever and whenever he wants. Why are people sitting in power not taking steps to seriously consider our security, economic and political attention? There is a question of $ 64 million. The elite sitting in power are also patriotic Pakistani. Unfortunately, the political approach that the country needs to move forward is not in our country. The divided parliament in which we have not yet decided whether the government is really the majority members or the members of the majority party are being excluded from the government through administrative measures. In short, even after 4 months, it could not be determined whether the government should be made of Form 45 or should Form 45 and 47 be a sign of political infertility. The government is the only institution that can track democracy in trouble. PTI leader Imran Khan is in jail. It is not possible for them to participate in any discussions and discussions and no dialogue can be initiated without them. The government wants to keep them out of the dialogue stages. In these circumstances \\\"Imran Khan. There should be a government compulsion to settle matters with The Problem \\\". For 16 months, a large part of the people stands firmly with this personality. Political and economic conditions require that the government sit with the PTI leadership so that progress can be made to resolve the issues. Your alliance is weak and weak. With regard to PTI, government allegations have not been reduced so far, nor have there been practically actions that prove that the government wants to move towards reconciliation. Due to terrorism, the Pakistani economy has lost billions of dollars in just a decade. The message of investment from our friend Malik China is welcome, but the country is also worried about the security issue. It would be a good step to talk to the PTI chief in the national interest. The concern about the security of the C -Pack II and the Chinese experts working on this project is a warning for us that we need to take steps to improve domestic security. A new security plan has been announced by the government. All the Pakistani people are living in the country or are living abroad, calling for the success of the new security plan called \\\"determination stability\\\", but once again the fear of the failure of this new plan is forcing many to think that \\\"my arms are tested\\\".\"}, {\"title\": \"Gwadar: Baloch solidarity committee protests, 3 killed, several arrested after clashes with security forces\", \"date\": \"2024-07-29\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, displaced, economic crisis, humanitarian situation, politically engineered\", \"content\": \"At least 3 people were killed and several injured as a result of clashes with the security personnel of the participants during the protest of the Baloch Solidarity Committee (BYC) in different areas of Balochistan, during which about 20 people were arrested. According to the Dawn newspaper Carport, despite the obstacles from the authorities, a large number of people managed to reach the Marine Drive of Gwadar from across the province for the Baloch Raji Machi (Baloch National gathering). Sources told Dawn that two people were killed and two were injured after a convoy was stopped by security forces at the Talar check post, officials claimed that the mob allegedly attacked the check post, in which the security forces were trying to defend themselves. In addition, a man lost his life and 8 people were injured in clashes on the use of tear gas to disperse the protesters gathered on the marine drive, during which about 20 people were arrested. Health officials confirmed the deaths during the clashes and told Dawn that three bodies and 8 injured were present at the hospital, two injured have been shifted to Turbat. Dawn tried to contact Balochistan Home Minister Ziaullah Lango and provincial spokesman Shahid Rind, but other concerned authorities including them could not be contacted. Later addressing the gathering in Gwadar, BYC leader Dr Mehrang Baloch and others said that they would continue their struggle to protect the rights of the people and the resources of the province. He demanded that the Baloch people's killers be arrested and brought to justice. In different parts of southern Balochistan, including Makran, the system was stalled, roads and highways going to Gwadar were closed all day, authorities blocked the road due to a sit -in in Mastung, there was no traffic on Quetta Karachi highway. A complete shutter -down strike was also carried out in Mastung, Kalat, Noshki, Khuzdar, Noshki, Dalbandin, Awaran, Lasbela, Chaggi, Nakandi, Gwadar, Turbat and Pasni. Similarly, BYC workers set up at least 14 places on highways and inter -provincial roads, roads leading to the Red Zone in Quetta were closed and hundreds of police and Levies personnel were deployed for security. Balochistan National Party (BNP Mengal) and National Party leaders condemned the use of force against peaceful supporters of BYC. BNP leader Sajid Tareen Advocate said his party would also participate in the demonstrations, he pointed out that people in Gwadar are still demanding clean water, urging the government to allow peaceful protests. He said that the Baloch and Pashtun people are being deliberately deprived of basic rights, which is increasing tensions and pushing people towards armed resistance. National Party leaders Aslam Baloch and Kulsoom Niaz Baloch blamed the Balochistan government for political instability in Balochistan under the leadership of Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti. He alleged that non -political forces were taking advantage of the current situation and the government was deliberately spreading unrest in Balochistan, claiming that civil martial law was imposed at the moment, and the 'puppet government' was deliberately worsening the situation.\"}]",
         "Based on the provided information and weather data, the likely IPC Phase for Kharan during Nov-Mar,2024-2025 is Phase 3 (Crisis). Key factors contributing to this assessment include:\n\n1. **Food Availability and Access**: The reliance on Ramadan markets and relief packages indicates existing food insecurity. Although some efforts are being made to manage shortages, these solutions point to underlying issues in food access and affordability.\n\n2. **Livelihoods and Economic Conditions**: Flood damage to crops and lands has impacted productivity and income for residents, reducing economic activity and likely affecting purchasing power for food and essentials.\n\n3. **Coping Mechanisms**: Heavy reliance on aid and subsidies suggests households are struggling to meet their basic needs without external assistance.\n\n4. **Environmental and Climatic Events**: Earlier reports of heavy rains and floods have caused significant infrastructural and agricultural damage. Although later months show minimal precipitation, these early environmental shocks could have long-lasting impacts on food production and access.\n\n5. **Health and Nutrition**: Health challenges, including a polio case and disrupted vaccination campaigns, contribute to vulnerability and nutritional insecurity, particularly for children.\n\n6. **Weather Data**: The high temperatures and minimal rainfall in subsequent months could exacerbate water stress and agricultural challenges, further affecting food availability.\n\nCombined, these indicators suggest that households in Kharan may face food consumption gaps and rely on crisis coping strategies, consistent with IPC Phase 3 (Crisis).",

March 12, 2025) Balochistan National Party chief Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal has said that the issue of Balochistan has gone beyond talks, in my personal opinion, parliamentary politics has become ineffective. Yes, KP and Balochistan are the colonies of Punjab, Sindh is being barren by making water to the dominant forces in Cholistan. I was not happening during the present government. If Bhutto was a democratic leader, we would not chant you slogans. Both the PPP and the PML -N are the product of dictatorship. They have expressed their views while talking to the local journalists of Khuzdar at his residence. Responding to various questions, Mangal, MPA Mir Jehanzeb Mengal, Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal said, \\\"I do not think that the problem of Balochistan can now be resolved through a dialogue. If it is done, who is ready to talk or who is ready to talk, is not a different point of view, but the leader is different. I now consider parliamentary politics to be ineffective now because it is not allowed to speak in parliament, the voice of elected nations of the oppressed nations is suppressed there, I was banned from speaking as far as it is concerned that the BNP will decide whether the party will decide whether the party will decide whether it is our party's decision. The writ is established. This world knows that at least the government's writ is not established in Balochistan, not young army and goes away. And Nach, Mangar, Bolan is the example of the hatred against the country in Balochistan today. In such a situation, expecting the good of the youth in such a situation is a raw idea. In response to the question of why the Baloch forces are not united, Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal said that we bring our personal differences into politics. Bitter experiences do not let us unite. In response to a question, Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal said that experiences and observations have proved that the real name of Pakistan is Punjab and Balochistan and goodwill are its colonies. Punjab is doing what they have to do with the colonies. They think that the people of Sindh are also oppressed. The economic dependence of the people of Sindh is on agriculture. Now, to make Sindh a cage, the river Sindh is extracting the canals for Cholistan. The powerful forces have been allotted to the powerful forces in Cholistan. I do such a trick to increase the share of my or Sindh. Akhtar Jan Mengal said that both the PPP and the PML -N are born of dictatorship and have a dictatorial thinking. It is futile to expect Bhutto as a democratic leader, but I think Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto does not have the power of the country. Referring to the withdrawal of the experts, he said that the withdrawal of Afghan refugees is a good thing, but the Pakistani government is taking this move to blackmail Afghanistan. Talking about the current situation in Balochistan, he said that the situation in Balochistan has reached the nasal.

They have sold women for dollars in exchange for dollars, a small example of this was Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, which was sold by General Pervez Musharraf to the United States with millions of dollars. Today, if Shahbaz Sharif Asif Zardari has been arrested and sold in exchange for dollars, it is not an embarrassment for Pakistan. He is suffering from himself today with billions of dollars in the name of jihad in Afghanistan. (Continued) These views were expressed in a special conversation with senior advocate Nadeem Girganadi yesterday. He said that the situation created in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Waziristan is the result of their own created and their own actions. First, they were left after they were plunged into the war of Afghanistan and achieved their goals. Today, the same people are now fighting against their own army, and the army is full of full force. In Balochistan, the situation has now reached the point that the rulers have intensified the war and on the other hand, the Baloch libertarians have also intensified their operations. The powerful powers throw their bodies after lifting the Baloch youths and disappears. He said that the way Baloch youths are thrown away after being lifted from their homes today, the Baloch genocide has become part of the constitution of Pakistan.

The ruling and the institutions claim that they see everything from the underground, but not taking action here proves that the government machinery itself is involved in the incident. The meeting with the district administration has also revealed that despite so many resources and responsibilities, it is their responsibility to provide peace and security, but it is not their responsibility. Loss, what do these personnel mean only to use government resources where the lives, property and dignity of the people are not safe, there are danger to the lives of the people.

He also appears to be disappointed about the 2024 elections, where according to him, the electoral process will be merely a political trick, in which the elected candidates will come through the support of the unseen forces, not through the support of the unidentified forces. According to Balochistan authorities, no real steps have been taken to solve the problems of the province. There are only a few votes, they always talk to each other for political interests and talk about the problems of Balochistan, but when it comes to solutions, they have no seriousness. They said that all the rulers coming to Balochistan have always tried to save their power and have never solved any real interest in Balochistan. From various political alliances such as Bhutto to PMA, MRD, and ARD, there have always been a timely alliance, which aims to achieve only one political goal. As soon as this goal is achieved, the big stakeholders of these alliances then withdraw from their promises and goals, and do not pay attention to the problems of Balochistan. We have heard numerous stories so far, but the solution we have is not that we have not understood them, but they have not decided to solve Balochistan. According to him, the problem of Balochistan is not just a literal problem but now it has become a combination of complex and numerous problems. The people of Balochistan needed development, basic facilities and constitutional rights, but now these issues have included constitutional, unconstitutional and fundamental rights. He added that if a TV anchor journalist tries to highlight the problems of Balochistan, he is targeted. Or is the case made on it, or it is removed overnight, or the channel in which he works, is expelled. He said that when one journalist is punished for highlighting the problems of Balochistan, these rulers are still working for their own interests despite the fact that the situation in Balochistan is not beneficial for Balochistan, and in other provinces where motorways are underway in Balochistan and other provinces. Development projects are being made, they are not in Balochistan. They said that people from other provinces are benefiting from Gwadar Port, but the people of Balochistan are deprived of it. Gwadar is still lacking in electricity and electricity is coming from Iran. He added that under the C -pack several power projects were approved, one was in Gwadar and the other in Gadani, whose foundation was laid by the Prime Minister himself. Akhjan Mengal said that other provinces have become rich thanks to the pack, while the people of Balochistan have not benefited. C -pack projects have provided people from other provinces for development and employment opportunities, but commenting on the laws imposed in Pakistan, the people of Balochistan have not benefited from it, saying that these laws are being enforced not only in Balochistan but all over Pakistan, and their purpose is to make the people of the country a liberal, and to the people of the country. The laws that are being made to trips are not acceptable in any democratic country. In a democratic country, no one can be prevented from freedom of expression, and even the media is imposing sanctions on expressing their views. Such an environment is reminiscent of Hitler or Genghis Khan's era, and these rulers may go to Berlin to prostrate to Hitler's grave, and they will decide on this country. Alliances are not just a name but it requires practical steps. He said that he is not taking the name of a particular political party, but the laws that are being made, whether through the assembly or by the present governments, cannot be expected to cooperate with us in solving the problems of Balochistan. I presented the resignation to the media and the Secretary of the Assembly was missing or the Speaker was missing and the resignation was submitted by the Secretary. Some people are saying that the witnesses should be brought along, but according to them it is their choice to adopt this method or not. In parliamentary politics, whether it be a provincial assembly, municipal elections or the National Assembly, they have tried all and they do not think that these assemblies can provide solutions to the problems of Balochistan. At the National Council meeting of the party, they will decide whether they will try to solve the problems of Balochistan in parliamentary politics. The Chief Minister is presenting a resolution regarding the repair of the dilapidated buildings of the Assembly, but according to him, the real problem is not the state of the buildings, but the system is bad, but the system is bad. He also says that such changes are made only for political benefit, which increases the privileges of some politicians. Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal said that the youth are fighting for Balochistan's struggle for the rights of Balochistan. Talking about the problems of Balochistan, every village of the province lacks basic facilities, especially health, employment, education, and lack of clean water. He said that unless the person or a political party that has the mandate of the people, there can be no change unless the people who have a business mindset and succeed in making money in the elections, they do not pay attention to public issues. He said that business people prefer their interests rather than solving public problems and therefore they will never be able to solve the problems of Balochistan seriously.\"}, {\"title\": \"Y.

In the name of improving the domestic economy, our rulers take the IMF every day in the hands of the IMF, sometimes the World Bank, and sometimes developed countries. The country's debt has reached such a level that there is a danger that the mafia imposed on the country will not sell the country. The corruption rulers have made the country bankrupt in economic terms. In Balochistan, various companies, including three mega projects, are currently engaged in carrying valuable minerals. We are forced to live unemployment and worse, despite having mineral resources and a vast coast. Other countries benefiting from the coast of Sendak, Ricardk and Gwadar are changing their destiny, but for the Balochistan all the doors of development are being closed. How can it be possible to eliminate unrest, lawlessness and corruption? Despite the success of the test under our young SB testing service these days, the door of the judiciary has been in place for the past several months. But it is sad to say that the judiciary also looks helpless in front of the elected government through Form 47. The Balochistan Grand Alliance is protesting across Balochistan on the central call. If the central leadership will jam the government machinery or even more than civil disobedience, the employees will not hesitate to sacrifice for it. The unprecedented, the Crete and the non -elected government are crying out for the treasury on the one hand, and on the other hand, the salaries of the parliamentarians and the ministers are raised. Such a process directly gives employees and the general public the impression that their times in this country are nothing more than a slave. The Balochistan Grand Alliance Khuzdar warns the government through today's press conference to change its cruel attitude and abandon the cruel policies against government employees or government agencies on the IMF's Emma. Withdrawal of pensions in the name of reforms should be withdrawn. The orphans should not be deprived of their rights by lifting the ban on the survivors. All employees should be paid equal salaries and payments. Government employees should be upgraded or according to promotion service rolls. The cruel service rolls should be amended. Permanent recruitment should be implemented instead of temporary recruitment for educated youth. Stop retaliation against government employees. Funds should be provided to make institutions active.

         "Based on the reported conditions and available weather data, Khuzdar is likely to experience significant food security challenges for the period Nov-Mar, 2024-2025.\n\n1. **Food Availability and Access**: Market disruptions from strikes during Ramadan and high food prices highlight difficulties in food access. Price increases can strain household budgets, reducing access to necessary food supplies.\n\n2. **Livelihoods and Economic Conditions**: Economic instability is amplified by unemployment and delayed construction projects. This unemployment issue lowers household incomes and access to food, increasing vulnerability.\n\n3. **Coping Mechanisms**: Reports of shortages of essential goods and increased crime indicate the use of negative coping strategies due to socio-economic stress.\n\n4. **Health and Nutrition**: Malnutrition concerns and health issues from adulterated food suggest deteriorating nutritional status. \n\n5. **Environmental and Climatic Events**: While there are no immediate environmental shocks, the recorded weather data show variability but not extreme conditions.\n\nCollectively, these indicators suggest Khuzdar is at an IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), where there are evident food consumption gaps and a heightened reliance on coping mechanisms that could negatively impact future food security.",

         "[{\"title\": \"\\\"Recent incidents of terrorism in Balochistan have uncovered state weakness'\", \"date\": \"2024-08-28\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, economic crisis, human rights abuses, displaced, power struggle\", \"content\": \"The terrorist attacks in the victim of chaos have shook the whole country. The militants not only targeted security installations but also took the passengers from the buses and checked their identity cards and killed them. It was the worst bloodshed day in the history of Balochistan, killing several people, including security personnel. Balochistan's banned separatist group claimed responsibility for the attacks. On the one hand, where these violent attacks identified the capabilities of major operations by the separatists, on the other hand, they also raise questions about the state's failure to tackle the serious security challenges spread from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan. Both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have become a battleground by militants challenging the state's writ. On the one hand, security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are dealing with groups that want to enforce Taliban principles, while on the other hand, separatist groups in Balochistan are spreading their violent acts across the province. The recent wave of violent attacks has uncovered the state's weakness and failure to deal with the situation. The number of personnel killed by security forces showed how serious the situation had become. It is clear that the Baloch separatist terrorists are now so organized and they have so much support that they are doing such successful acts. It is no surprise that all these attacks took place in a region that has been the focus of political dissatisfaction for a long time. Earlier, for two decades, there have been low intensity attacks in the province from time to time, but now it is turning into a uprising due to increasing distrust of the locals. Recent violent acts were carried out at a time when public demonstrations in southern Balochistan have passed a few weeks. It was not only targeted terrorist attacks but also clashes with the security forces of the miscreants and the main highway connected to the province with other provinces of the country was also blocked. In unverified footage, we saw Turbat, the second largest city in the province, patrolling the streets. Government personnel were also targeted. The situation in the affected areas has completely out of hand while the administration has failed to handle the situation. The most worrying incident was to take passengers from buses and kill passengers on the main highway connecting Balochistan. This is not the first of this kind but it was a very disgusting event. Militants are targeting a large number of non -local people, most of whom belong to the working class. Such attacks have given separatist militancy a horrific direction. There is no opinion that no state will tolerate such violent attacks and those who challenge the state's writ. There is no doubt that the state has the right to use force to tackle this kind of terrorism. But at the same time, it is also important that we also consider the reasons for the political anxiety found in the province as to why the rebellion is increasing. Despite the use of force, the state has failed to suppress the growing uprising in the province. In fact, the local population of democratic and economic rights has reinforced rebel thinking. The growing incidence of force and disappearance in suppressing the protests has incited the fire of anger among the local population, especially the youth, and thus the number of devout people recruited into separatist groups has increased. What happened this week cannot be seen separately from all these angles. The responsibility of these tragic events also lies on the state, which also failed to hear the right demands of the people. The recent terrorist attacks took place on the anniversary of Nawab Akbar Bugti, who has been a former governor and chief minister of Balochistan, while he was also a very important and influential tribal leader. He was killed in a military operation on August 26, 2006. His death led to the third (largest) wave of rebellion in Balochistan. Unlike the last two waves, the focus of these rebel operations is not the region where tribal elders are dominated. Most leaders of the separatist groups belong to the educated background, unlike the middle class and tribal leaders. Recently, Tariq Khosa recently wrote about how the state atrocities defied Bolan Medical College Gold Medalist Dr Allah Nazar. Baloch Liberation Front leader Allah Nazar was abducted by intelligence agencies in 2005. His brother was killed in illegal custody. The stories of other devout people are no different. The endless series of forced disappearances and tortured bodies have attracted many people belonging to the affected families to militancy. Even peaceful protesters against the excesses of the state were declared a traitor. This is a poor way to handle security issues, which is the most important reason behind the current tense situation in the province. I remember that I was part of a media briefing that was given by a senior security officer in Quetta in January 2017. In this briefing, he described 'sub -nationalism' as the biggest problem. According to him, the most important task for security agencies is to make such people sincere to Pakistan, nationalists for Pakistan. When I asked the question why being a Baloch nationalist is wrong and what is about being a Pakistani, I was not answered in this regard. Such colonial thinking is also an important reason that Baloch nationalist leaders decided to participate in mainstream politics. All efforts were made to keep nationalist leaders out of power. The way the political parties were formed and they were given power in the province made fun of the democratic process. The February 8 elections are probably the worst example of how the system was scattered to form a government in the province. But this government, which has a controversial reputation, has been challenged by the power of the people and we have seen this in the recent protests and marches in Gwadar and Turbat. These protesters are not separatists or terrorists, but the state still tried to put them off the wall through their actions. No country can overcome terrorism by defrauding its population. The fact cannot be ruled out that these separatists have the patronage of external elements on which they are able to attack. But external forces also benefit only when the situation in the region is already in turmoil.

And if China expects help from China, China will never take a stand against Iran because China's relations with Iran look better than us at the moment and take advantage of all this situation, India and Afghanistan will push the heels to kill our security. The situation in Balochistan has worsened. Without controlling terrorism, the country cannot be taken to real stability. If internal stability in Pakistan cannot be ensured, the country will remain weak in the field of foreign affairs. The global and regional situation is changing rapidly and Pakistan is in the throes of the effects of these changes. At the national level, the political instability and the economy have increased the difficulties for Pakistan. In the immediate effects of Pakistan, China and the United States are increasing with the growing situation in Afghanistan and the situation in Pakistan. There are several hideouts of terrorist groups like BLA and BLF in Iran, who are crossing the Pak -Iran border and targeting Pakistan's security forces and civilians. Several prominent rebels of these terrorist organizations are living with their families there. For 74 years, deep friendship has been going on in Pakistan and Iran. The regular agreement of this friendship was signed in the 1950s, after which on several occasions, the two Islamic countries have been friendly. Despite the 950km long border between Pakistan and Iran, there is no border dispute, but the operations of separatist terrorist organizations on both sides on the same border have a pain for both countries. The territories on both sides of the Pak -Iran border are the \\\"Saif Haven\\\" of terrorists. In Balochistan, terrorists are hiding in the Iranian border area. In Pakistan, their relatives make them missing and create difficulties for the government. Terrorist hideouts in Pakistan and Iran's border are a threat to the security of the two countries. These armed groups have not been allowed to establish peace in Pakistan and Iran for decades, causing global problems for both countries, while the border areas are constantly suffering from ignorance and constant unemployment. These organizations fulfill the terrorist agenda by collecting wealth from smuggling. Smuggling is causing huge damage to the Pakistani economy. Items, petroleum products, cement, ceramic tiles and other items are coming to Pakistan illegally. That is how Pakistan is going from Iran. This illegal business causes the Pakistani economy imbalance. It is a happy future that Pakistan has still maintains trade ceremonies despite Iran's tensions, while world leadership also looks concerned with Pakistan Iran tensions. China and Turkey have offered mediation to end the tension between Pakistan and Iran. The UK has asked the two countries to show patience. According to a statement issued by the US spokesperson, the United States has warned Iran that such provocations are unacceptable and can have serious consequences. Russia has also called for patience on Pakistan and Iran, saying that further tensions in the situation will be equivalent to becoming a toy in the hands of those who are not interested in peace and security in the region. Iran's tensions with Pakistan are certainly a threat to regional and global peace and security. Therefore, the causes of this tension need to be overcome with understanding. If the deal is like the United States in the heart of Iran that it can invade any country for its protection, then Pakistan has the full right to take any steps to defend itself against any such aggression. No one should be misunderstood in this case.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan government announces 3 -day mourning in the province\", \"date\": \"2024-02-07\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"terrorism, displaced\", \"content\": \"The caretaker government Balochistan announced a three -day mourning in the province after the blasts in Pishin and Fort Saifullah.

Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif said that efforts were made to make a statement against Pakistan through fake videos, Indian media tried to destroy the country's identity with false videos. The spokesman added that the terrorists left a group of hostages on the night of March 11 on a linguistic basis, which had some logistic reasons because so many people could not be controlled, secondly, they had to give themselves the impression of being a humanitarian friend. He said that the terrorists left some of their comrades on the train and a large number went to their hideouts in the mountains, after which the security forces targeted them and this was the first time. According to the spokesman of the Pakistan Army, the terrorists were in constant contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the entire terrorist operation, adding that on the morning of March 12, our forces targeted the terrorists through snipers. He said that on the afternoon of March 12, the Special Services Group (SSG) was killed by the operation and targeted suicide bombers between the hostages with the help of sniper.\\nExit escaped in different directions. SSG's Zarar company enters the train with a young engine - Photo: Dawn News Lieutenant General Ahmed Shahrif said that the hostage of the train managed to escape outside the train, while SSG's Zarar company's young engine entered the train via the engine. He said that the operation was done so skillfully that no innocent hostage was killed during the entire operation, the evidence that took place before the operation was started. The spokesman said that the terrorists had foreign weapons and equipment, food was provided to the passengers recovered in the operation and shifted to a safe place under the supervision of the forces, during the press conference, various stages of operation and transfer to the hostages were shown. The spokesman said that the incident was the most successful incident in the history of the train hostage in history, where despite the presence of suicide bombers at a remote location within 36 hours, the Pak Army, the Air Force and the FC completed the operation with full planning. He said that this is another incident of terrorism that links to the neighboring country of Afghanistan, it is part of the ongoing process, because the structures that come here are part of it, the suicide bombers who come here are Afghans. Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry showed pictures on the screen, saying that the recently killed foreign Badruddin was the son of the deputy governor of Baghdis, the foreign governor was a battalion commander in the Afghan army and was terrorizing Pakistan, and was still a terrorist. He added that the weapons they received from them were also brought from Afghanistan, but the main sponsor of the incidents that took place in Balochistan and the incidents that took place before is the main sponsor. On this occasion, the DGISPR showed confessional video statements of Indian spy Kulbhushan Yadav, in which he said that RAW's goal and purpose is to carry out numerous terrorist acts in Balochistan. To facilitate them so that they can target specific goals, and all operations of the military -style can be carried out because the Balochistan movement is not through the sea, the purpose is to provide safe land to the Baloch nationalists and to be fully coordinated by the sea. The army, which is their internal environment, also showed the statement of the Baloch surrenders, in which they are saying that 'no war is taking place, people are killing the innocent Baloch only for their own personal interests, in all these conspiracies, especially India.' Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said that therefore, the Jafar Express incident has happened, it is a continuation of the same policy, and it was pushed there to work. \\\"We thank God and offer greetings, to the brave young men who saved innocent lives from their authority, boldness, a very dangerous situation,\\\" he said. Responding to a question, the DGISPR said that Pakistan and law enforcement agencies fight against what is around it, the whole nation has to fight against terrorism. Similarly, the previous government had given a revised National Action Plan, which had 14 points, and the 14 -point vision is involved in stability. All stakeholders agree that if they do 14 work, terrorism will end. Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry further said that there is a point in 14 points, which is related to Kinatic that no military / armed group will be allowed to operate. He said that the next point is to prevent the spread of terrorism through the media (social, print, electronic), as well as effective steps will be taken in terms of religious sectarian terrorism, while it is also the point that terror financing will be stopped, illegal spectrum will be controlled. The DGISPR said that the next point is that likewise, anti -terrorism cases will be worked out in the courts, the capacity of anti -terrorism will be enhanced, madrassas will be registered and registered. He said that one of the points, I tell me where we are in it, in 2024 law enforcement agencies conducted 59,775 intelligence -based operations, conducted 11,654 intelligence -based operations by mid -March in 2025, which means are 180 daily operations. Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif said that around 1250 terrorists have been carried out in 2024 and 2025, 563 young men have entrusted their lives to Allah in the way of protecting the people of Pakistan, so it is being done at all times, every moment. He added that one of the reasons for the rise is that terrorism is slowly getting space in Afghanistan, there are centers of temptation in Afghanistan, they have leadership there, they are being trained. The DGISPR said that when the coalition forces have been withdrawn from Afghanistan, the night vision devices are there in large numbers, which are available to these terrorist organizations, as the next reason is that we must admit that for the first time, the state of Pakistan is fighting against this illegal spectrum, which includes a large number of smuggling, smuggling and smuggling. Includes He said that it is hundreds of billion dollars of mafia, the mafia that does not want the work to end the work they are hollowing out freely, they also support terrorism. Spokesman Pak Army said that the enemies of the state who do not want Pakistan to develop their potentials, who have no ideas. Talking about the missing persons, he said that there was a commission on this issue and it has been working since 2011, whoever claims that Missing Persons are, they have the right to go to this commission. He said that the total cases reported on this commission in Balochistan are 2,911, only 452 are left. All the rest have been resolved, so the state is resolving the issue, but there are some questions from the state. You give that list, are they not a Missing Person, give a list of temptations. The DGISPR said that give a list of those who are in the training centers in Balochistan, who are those people, what is their status? In these human smuggling, your children are drowning, of them are quite missing, in Karachi every day, the hard work that comes to work on the sidewalks, many of them become dear to Allah, they have been declared as luxurious, they have been buried, hundreds but thousands of people have been buried. He said that the US, the United Kingdom and India are also missing, where in which country do they climb their forces and their institutions? He further said that if these are Missing, then thousands of people in Pakistan who have been victimized by this terror, including civilians, army personnel and policemen, do not their children miss their parents? They don't miss their martyr father? Talking to a question on intelligence failure, Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif said that intelligence needs a lot of information, because a lot is happening, if you look at the context of Balochistan, it is 44 % of the province of Pakistan, while 50 % of it consists of mountains and 20 % of the night, and 20 % of the nights are in the desert. Could He said that before there is an accident, neutralizes it, but in intelligence where you see failure, which you point out, you said it is a failure of intelligence, which I do not agree with, there are thousands of intelligence successes, which you do not know. He said that intelligence agencies are heartbroken day and night for the citizens of Pakistan, it should be careful to call intelligence failure. Responding to a question, the DGISPR said that 33 terrorists were hell in the Jaffar Express operation, the number was more of them, when they removed the people from the train and took hostage, they left a Small group here and the rest of the groups were going back to the mountains. He said that it takes a while to contact the forces but the observation starts soon, so they went ahead at a certain distance, they were going to different parties, our analysis is that a large number of them were killed, but not all were killed. He said that where the operation took place on the train, which was carried out by snipers and Zarar, there were a total of 33 hells. Responding to a question on the BLA's claim to take hostage, the DGISPR said that they did not have enough time to take a hostage to their secrets, the terrorists were going themselves, there were no hostages with them, all the hostages were present. Lieutenant General Ahmad Sharif said on the question of the casualties in the attack on Jafar Express, a total of 26 passengers were martyred in the incident, 354 hostages were recovered, including 37 injured, he said that 18 martyrs belonged to the army and 5 others. He said that during the entire operation, there were 5 FC operational testimonies in which 3 FC personnel were attacked by terrorists before the train attacked the checkpoint. An FC personnel were killed in a firing on the morning of the shooting of the terrorists while the terrorists were killed in the firing of the terrorists. Has been Earlier, at the start of the press conference, Chief Minister Balochistan Sarfraz Bugti said that the security forces pay tribute to the successful operation, it is commendable for the Pak army to release the hostages. Sarfraz Bugti has said that the elements that spread the unrest will not be exempted, it has decided to treat separatists as terrorists. Balochistan Chief Minister thanks to the US, China, Russia, Britain, Iran, Turkey, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Europe, the UN Secretary and the European Ambassador for condemning the attack on Jaffar Express. Sarfraz Bugti said that in Baloch traditions, such incidents are seen in a view that has nothing to do with the Baloch traditions, the Baloch traditions are trustworthy, but the terrorists have disrupted all these traditions, so I say they should not be called Baloch. He said that just as the terrorists who have been terrorizing in the name of Islam have nothing to do with Islam, the terrorists in the name of Balochit have nothing to do with Baloch. Sarfraz Bugti said, \\\"I want to say one thing and answer that the Afghan land is being used against us, it is happening long ago, they have signed a contract with the world in Doha that their land will not be used against anyone else. It will also have to think that the world is not only for Pakistan.\\\" He was asked how much the case of the missing persons is associated with terrorism. In response to the question, the Chief Minister said that even if a person is missing, no justification can be made. He added that however, if it was used as a propaganda tool against the state, it should be condemned. If you look in the world, are there only missing persons in Pakistan? What is the number of Missing Persons in the developed countries of the world? How many people are missing in the US and the UK and then in the region? He said that this is an issue in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and elsewhere in Pakistan but why is Balochistan repeated again and again? Chief Minister Balochistan said that terrorists are not fighting on this basis, terrorism has nothing to do with backwardness, this debate is not right, their purpose is to break the country and they want to do through violence. It may be recalled that on March 11, the terrorists blew up the railway track in the Bolan Pak area, and attacked the Jaffar Express and took more than 400 passengers hostage. Although the remote area was facing difficulties, security forces conducted a major operation to save the hostages in Bolan Pass in the Dhadar area. Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry, Director General of the Pakistan Army Department of Public Relations (ISPR), said the next day that the hostages of Jaffar Express were recovered and all 33 terrorists were killed, but before the operation began, 21 terrorists killed 21 civilians.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan: 3 miners kidnapping in Daki, family sit -in\", \"date\": \"2024-03-24\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"displaced, economic crisis, apathy, humanitarian situation, humanitarian disaster\", \"content\": \"Gunmen kidnapped 3 miners on Friday night in Daki Coal Field area of \\u200b\\u200bBalochistan.

Heavy force and other law enforcement personnel of the Levies force arrived on the spot and resisted the armed men, but the kidnappers managed to escape with miners in exchange for firing.

The committee also approved a supplementary grant of Rs 27 crore 62 lakh for FC Headquarters North, along with a special grant of Rs 20 billion for the stability of the operation, the statement said. The Economic Coordination Committee allowed another one million metric tonnes of sugar to export, saying that exporting sugar to Afghanistan would have to be asked for funds from the banking channel in advance. It was stated that only mills paying dues to sugarcane farmers would be able to export sugar, while the condition of retaining Rs 145 per kg of retail price was also abolished. After the condition of retaining retail price at Rs 145 per kg, the country has increased the risk of rising sugar prices. It may be recalled that the meeting of the Sugar Advisory Board, chaired by Minister for Industry and Production Rana Tanveer, was recommended to export one lakh tonnes of additional sugar in the country. Earlier, at a board meeting of the week, 40,000 tonnes of sugar was proposed to Tajikistan at the government level. It is also worth mentioning here that according to the Dawn newspaper report, the government has already exported 1.5 million tonnes of sugar in the last one month. The government had banned its exports for four years to overcome sugar shortage and prices in the country, but last month the government was lifted the ban.\"}, {\"title\": \"The development of Balochistan, but how?\", \"date\": \"2024-05-24\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict\", \"content\": \"All patriots know this fact and believe that Balochistan is the heart of Pakistan. In Balochistan, peace and prosperity of the people there are also wishing for everyone and there have been tireless efforts for a long time to achieve these goals, in which the Pak army and other institutions have an important role. The question arises as to what is the obstacle to the development of Balochistan and who are the people who do not want to see the development of this province and the prosperity of the people there. If all, all have to acknowledge the facts together and unite and play their role for development and prosperity there, which is the right of the people there. There is no denying that the most important obstacle to the development of Balochistan is an attempt to sabotage the efforts of the law and order. Terrorist organizations do not want development and prosperity in Balochistan by becoming the instrument of Pakistan's enemies. In fact, these elements are the enemies of the people of Balochistan. Of course, the people of Balochistan are poor and patriotic. Some misguided elements are trying to burn their own house by setting fire to a terrorist. These elements combine Balochistan's simple iron and raw -minded youth like a devil. On the one hand, these elements of Pakistan enemies try to make the people of Balochistan terrorized and try to lose their development. On the other hand, they make nasty conspiracies to disperse them through false propaganda against Pakistan's security agencies and other provinces. In the terrorists who are guided by the guidance, they surrender and surrender and become part of the efforts made for the development of Balochistan. An example of this is Gulzar Imam Shinbe. He was born in 1978 in the village of Panjgur. Before joining the terrorist group in 2009, the contractor and a local newspaper also worked as a correspondent. In 2017, he made a long visit to India on fake documents, which is a terrorist training. There he was given further terrorist training. In addition, with huge financial support, it was taught how he could mislead the youthful and simple iron Baloch youth through psychological tactics to become a fuel for terrorist fire. In 2023, Pakistan's proud intelligence agencies arrested Gulzar Imam Shinbee, who was working as the operational head of the terrorist organization, who was currently operating as Baloch Raj Ajui Sangar (BRAS). Now he has been working with the state of Pakistan for a year. Subsequently, the head of the BNM organization, Sarfraz Bangalzai, also announced his joining the national mainstream with 70 of his comrades. After that, the Baloch organization was completely abolished. These examples are the light for those who are still the instrument of the enemies of the country against their country, province and the people. All of them should also be part of the caravan of development and prosperity of their provinces and the people instead of destroying their world. These elements exaggerate and make noise on the Sons of Missing, while most Missing Persons are hiding in terrorist camps. In the name of Sons on Missing, the elements of the name of Sons actually try to cope with those who join the terrorist organizations. The latest examples of these are the Vadodsatakzai and Karim Jan Baloch, who were involved in terrorist attacks in Mach and Gwadar, and for them, they were rang Baloch and other long marches, which some others were also supported. The people of Balochistan are the real heirs of their province who will not allow the miscreants to hijack the development agenda. Just as Gulzar Shinbe expressed his dissatisfaction over his 15 -year -old terrorist activities, the rest should be followed and that is the right way.\"}, {\"title\": \"Balochistan: FC Fort in Gulistan failed, 2 terrorists killed\", \"date\": \"2025-01-28\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"conflict, displaced, violent suppression\", \"content\": \"Security forces foiled an attempt to infiltrate unidentified gunmen in the Fort of the Frontier Corps (FC) in Gulistan area of \\u200b\\u200bQala Abdullah district of Balochistan.

The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has claimed responsibility for these terrorist incidents, but the real planner was the Indian intelligence agency \\\"RAW\\\", which fully supported it. It is also unlikely to support the Kharijites who attacked Pakistan with their safe havens in Afghanistan. The Pakistan Army and the law enforcement agencies have retaliated and killed 21 terrorists while their 14 men were martyred.

On the same day, the Kharijit hidden in Afghanistan bombed a bomb in Razmak's Bazaar in North Waziristan, killing four people and injuring 18. The BLA's destroyers also blew up a 36 -inch diameter pipeline providing gas to Punjab in Dera Bugti and also attacked the para -military camp in Bella.

During the meeting, the President and the Prime Minister were briefed on the recent terrorist incidents in Balochistan and proposals for peace in the province were considered.  In a meeting with the two leaders, the President emphasized on effective measures for the complete elimination of terrorists and said that every possible step should be taken to improve the security situation in Balochistan. The two leaders also met Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and gave a full briefing on the situation in Balochistan. The Prime Minister said that the attacks in Balochistan yesterday were cowardly operations and no justification for these cowardly acts can be justified. He paid tribute to the martyrs in the attack and said that the brave security forces thwarted the terrorists' ambitions. The Prime Minister directed to improve the law and order situation in Balochistan and to identify the terrorists and take full action. It is to be remembered that the militant group Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) killed 40 people in different incidents in Musa Khel, Mastung, Bolan and Kalat in a single day while 21 terrorists were killed in retaliation by security forces.

In the small incidents of terrorism, military personnel, security personnel, civilians, civil servants, scholars are sacrificing their lives on their homeland by making a new history. We raise their fingers in distrust of the institutions, the opposition blames the government about it. The government cries of spreading political instability on the opposition. The institutions have many positive expectations from the youth, emphasizing the need for national unity. Young prisoners are relied on at number 804. Powerful institutions want political stability as well as political stability and demand full support and support on internal and external fronts in the fight against terrorism, but the people blame them for all the deterioration without any evidence. Baloch is killing Punjabi, Sindhi is confronting the federation with its rights and a new canal dispute. The PTI's 14 -year -old government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa demands that the Afghan Taliban and banned TTP have to hold direct talks with the federal government, while the federal government accuses the Gandapur government of providing shelter to banned terrorist organizations. It is not difficult to explain to the KP government but it is becoming impossible. The spirit of the Darul Uloom Haqqaniya Akora Khattak was martyred in the Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani attack. Burqa -covered suicide bombers invaded Bannu Kent. The PTI government's administrative control over most of the districts in KPK has ended. Kurram's conditions are still worrying. Actors of Afghanistan's sponsored terrorist organizations, including banned TTP, are moving all over the province. They kidnap or kill whom they want. A great incident of Balan train hijacking has passed, security forces personnel, 33 terrorists were sent to hell as a result of timely operation of Pak Air Force, 22 civilians were killed and 4 FC personnel were killed. In such a case, the parliament continued to post mortem of the president's address in his mouth. No one thought that in this emergency, the ongoing proceedings of the House should be suspended and some four words should be condemned by the terrorists' action. Sadly, people who forgot their national responsibilities in the lure of rooms, bungalows, cars, notes, petrol, protocol and privileges. Disappointment is frustrated on all sides. In Balochistan, the game of fire and blood continues in the name of the BLA separation movement and we are in a state of war. The priorities of the provincial government are the construction of a new building by demolishing the old building of the provincial assembly instead of terrorism. For this, millions of rupees have been released overnight. It is heard that the governor is a federal representative in the province and the wishes of this constitutional official in Balochistan are being fulfilled in such a way that a plan is to waste crores of rupees on the construction of the new governor's house. What to mourn! Shedding tears on the martyrdom of the martyrs or telling the stories of the rulers' luxuries. Opposition is running its shop in the name of release of prisoner No. 804. The rulers are scaring others in the name of political salvation from this prisoner, and they are shaking them both on their fingers. What are the lifeless roles of the puppet spectacle? Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are burning. Seeing our mistakes, the seeds of separatism in Balochistan have become a trees today. There is no power there. Justice has become seventy -seven except justice. The streets are being cut off in the neighborhood over minor disputes. The bodies are being dropped on resistance during the looting. Terrorism, kidnapping, murder, fighting conflicts are becoming a routine of our lives and moods. You and I am pleased and satisfied by making you a blasphemous accusation. Instead of praying our prayers, it has become our social hobby to focus on counting the rak'ahs of others. The terrorists, whether the BLA or the banned TTP, are two sides of the same coin. They are united on the same agenda anti -Pakistan and where do we stand? Can we not agree on the agenda of saving Pakistan? Remember that the terrorist's father was neither son nor his mother or sister. The terrorist is only a terrorist. If anyone thinks that negotiations with the terrorists will resolve the issues, then this is a fantasy. The thing has gone beyond that. Understand the international conspiracy under the guise of terrorism.

In these operations, several foreign terrorists have been arrested and many have been arrested. In these operations, officers and men of the Pak army, police and other law enforcement agencies have been martyred. But even so, peace has not been possible. Al -Khwaraj terrorists are a hot process for the destruction of Balochistan under a regular plan. The purpose of targeting the Punjabis and KP workers is to destroy the business of Balochistan people. The purpose of targeting Chinese engineers is to sabotage C -Pack and other development projects. Who are a milestone for the development of Balochistan and the economic prosperity of the people there. The purpose of creating an atmosphere of panic in Balochistan is the destruction of Balochistan and the people there. Of course not. Minerals and fruit rich but the most backward province of Balochistan is the most important highway in trade with Iran and Central Asian countries. The second largest port of Gwadar is also in Balochistan. SeaPeak can open new avenues for development and prosperity in this province. It is clear to all that the enemy does not want all this and wants to stop the development of this province by creating unrest and uncertainty in Balochistan through the foreigners. But unfortunately and sadly, some of the misguided elements of Balochistan are seeking to burn their house by becoming the enemy's hands. These misguided elements have created their own organizations, which are living in luxury themselves. But some of the Balochistan youths would be involved and then send them to kill and kill them in their own province to kill and die. Balochistan -based supporters run a campaign under various names and are trying to defame Pakistani intelligence agencies and the Pak army by defying these youths. It has become their responsibility that such \\\"lost\\\" youth are responsible for the disappearance of the militants. It is a government weakness that all these so -called motions are operating inside and publicly. They make speeches against the state and state institutions by giving a sit -in in Islamabad. In Balochistan, highways and businesses are forcibly closed for several days, but despite doing all this, the state has not yet taken any concrete action against them. How is it possible to stop the terrorists when facilitators are present and free? Answering this question needs to be reviewed with neutral and realistic thinking. And that is, like other provinces of the country, the people of Balochistan get equality rights. Are serious and repeated steps taken for the economic prosperity of the people there? Are the educational facilities available to the people there? Are roads, electricity and gas facilities available like other provinces? Is there an easy and free convenience of the poor for every poor? Do the youth there get government jobs on merit, merit and easily? Even today, in some cities, electricity, gas, rare and roads are not extinct in some cities. There are many more questions that contain the above answers but hidden. Is it the responsibility of the army to sacrifice its lives for the establishment of law and order and continue to work with its budget? What disease is governments? There will be some part of it, then enjoy and continue to increase illegal wealth by looting. Now it will not go more. Before the military operation in Balochistan, it is more important and better to take credible, important and sincere political leaders in confidence. What is the reason that the patriotic political leaders there are not joined in confidence to prevent unrest in Balochistan. How can efforts for peace can be successful unless the house is with the elder? Apart from this, the young people there can also cure the disease by taking them into confidence and with immediate steps for development and prosperity.

We want a national unity against the temptation, but do not feel the need that it is not possible to dispose of external temptations without controlling internal temptation. The fabric of BLA terrorist attacks in Balochistan is a meaningful and response from the countries that are connected to the countries with which our Foreign Ministry is connected. When the enemy is openly invading our state, why not raise a clear voice on international forums. Balochistan is burning. Terror incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are on the rise. Chief Minister Balochistan Sarfraz Bugti is describing the situation in his province, saying that reading the national anthem in public educational institutions will have to be mandatory. The educational institutions whose heads cannot obey these orders should voluntarily withdraw from their positions. Extortion will not be done at a check post. No highway will be closed. Balochistan is a trustee of culture traditions in which the killing of passengers, innocent laborers cannot be thought of. Offering a constitutional oath is essential. Not bowing down to anti -state elements, restoration of peace is our top priority. The only difference is that Sarfraz Bugti, in the official language, describes the seriousness of the situation in Balochistan, is that when a journalist or social media activist describes the same situation in the unofficial language, it is taken under the Pika Act. Chief Minister Balochistan is actually admitting that the situation in his province is getting worse. In such a case, overseas activities of internal temptation are condemnable and considered that when the whole country is in a state of war and Fatan al -Khawaraj is closed against us, the central leader of the PTI, Dr Arif Alawi, the central leader of the PTI and former president of Pakistan, and his abroad, have taken their internal political war on human rights. The question arises as to what kind of disgusting game they are playing for the release of the individual and want to impose sanctions on state officials. What are the motivations? The proposed bill also demanded from the US administration to mark the key people involved in suppressing political opponents in Pakistan and included their names in the list of sanctions. The bill is released by the political prisoners, so the bill gives the US president more authority to lift sanctions. The followers of our most popular political leader are such that they are said to have said that we do not need any external enemy. We specialize in cutting our roots. Those who chant the slogan of \\\"We are a slave\\\" look at their poor people who are slaves and against whom are they plotting? Those who invite American intervention should take the nails of consciousness. These are the people who are not ready to say two words against the terrorists and are claiming to be a human rights abuser, and we are fools expecting such people to expect a better future of the country. The social media networks of these elements have been launched against the military leadership for the past few days, and the allegations are being spread. Has anyone ever wondered what the goals of this disgusting campaign are? Obviously, these people are conspiring to strengthen the hands of the enemy forces by weakening the state institutions of Pakistan. On the other hand, the arrests of journalists under the Pica Act are less condemnable. The better the rulers and the powerful circles avoid the indiscriminate arrests of journalists, the better it is. The domestic situation requires honest comments, the facts about the deteriorating law and order situation and the control of terrorist elements should be stated. Every independent Pakistani citizen has the right to give free opinion. It is not bold journalism to break the facts. It is the real journalism to describe matters and events to the extent of reality. Responsible circles think about this with a cool mind and adopt a strategy that does not have the atmosphere of fear. The arrests of politicians, social media activists and journalists, registration of cases is not the solution to the problems. All stakeholders once again sit down and adopt a viable unanimous strategy to get out of this crisis, which can help eliminate the diminished environment. The only opinion is repeatedly given that political leadership should be given unconditional permission to play its political role. The deteriorating situation in Balochistan is urgently needed to start the political dialogue immediately. This move will strengthen the hands of the military leadership in the fight against terrorism.

It was the first of its kind of hijacking. Earlier, the terrorists have bombed the train tracks and have tried to remove the trains from the tracks, but they have never tried to host the entire train and the riders.

Today we are one of the poorest countries in the region. In 1995, Pakistan was six degrees in the UN Human Development Index and 18 degrees ahead of Bangladesh. With regard to the same index, today we are 29 degrees behind India and have fallen back 32 degrees from Bangladesh. Has our style of governance really spoiled that it has stopped working at all? There are four major responsible in our provinces: health, education, police and a few other civilian responsibilities such as water supply, cleaning of the area and building roads and maintaining them. The people expect the government to properly provide these important services. Let's start talking to health. The mortality rate of newborn children in Pakistan is second in the world, with the situation better than Pakistan in all the other countries of Africa, besides Lesotho and South Sudan. 40 % of our children are left physically and mentally weak due to lack of proper diet. 17 % of our children and 42 % of women have anemia due to anemia, ie steel deficiency. In the field of education we should start with these two facts: 78 % of our ten years of children cannot read two sentences in any language, and 26 million children are out of school. The quality of education is that according to the AESR survey of 2023, only 45 % of the children studying in the fifth grade can solve the question of mathematics of the second grade and the rate in Sindh and Balochistan is less than 30 %. It is relatively easy to talk to the police. If a simple question is to be asked whether most Pakistani police are a blessing or bother? So we think readers are well aware of how useful this police service is in their lives. Finally, let's talk about urban services. In most parts of our largest city, the pipe does not get water and the situation is getting worse. Water is sold to people by tankers so that the mafia can make money. Every year, for several weeks, our second major city, Lahore, does not have such a happen in which humans can breathe. The garbage removal system in urban areas is very poor and except the privileged urban areas are not equal. It is common for sewerage drains to be open across Pakistan. In addition to motorways in Punjab, which is also taken care of by the federal government or some of the roads that are used by VIPs, the average road situation in Pakistan is very poor. So it is quite clear that the performance in these four important areas of our provinces is very poor. Remember that Pakistani taxpayers pay Rs 12,000 billion annually to the provinces for these \\\"services\\\" provided by the provinces. The average pays 50 thousand rupees to the Pakistani provincial governments annually. To meet the government's expenditure and other expenses, we have imposed the highest income and sales tax on our people. We pay 38.5 % on our salaried class (including teachers), 49.5 % of our businessmen (including doctors), and 59 % tax on companies (including exporters). And after paying income tax, the government's sales tax of almost everything we buy, including the milk and medical devices of children, makes it 18 % more expensive. The failure of the state does not mean that the federal government is running better in any respect. How well it works can be gauged from the fact that we provide the most expensive electricity and gas in not only our South Asian territory but also in the global revenue countries such as South Africa, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. Today, the total number of foreign airlines coming to Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad is only less than the foreign airlines arriving at Dhaka Airport. In 2022, our flagship PIA suffered a loss of Rs 88 billion and this year 4.5 million passengers traveled to PIA. This means that our taxpayers, ie, pay Rs 19,500 to the PIA for every passenger traveling on the PIA. The PIA deficit is similarly increasing. Our railways will work for less than 2.9 crore passengers this year but subsidy of Rs 109 billion will be given. That is, once again subsidy of Rs 3700 for each passenger's journey will pay us taxpayers per person. Our government companies will lose more than Rs 750 billion this year. Your hard work has been earned and the amount collected after paying taxes at the higher level will be met. Despite such a big and permanent loss, our government is unable to make any reforms. We have seen only our governments grow even greater and more indebted than ever. Our style of government has developed in a system that can build meetings, committees, SROs and ordinances, but no one can take concrete steps for the public. Ask yourself: What facilities are providing you with the federal or provincial governments today? If we adopt an individual freedom, social justice and small government -based model by eliminating this colonial, elite and the state system, there is no reason why we will back our South Asian neighbors in a few years. What steps do we need to take? Transfer education, water and sewerage to the district level, and move the roads, police and health to the division level. The federal government should transfer funds directly to divisions and districts. There should be no more than ten ministries at the provincial level and 15 ministries at the federal level. All government companies need to be privatized. Airports and railway stations should also be handed over to the private sector. Reduce government regulations and simplify the procedure. Reduce income and sales tax. Reduce electricity and gas prices. Make the rest of the public schools to run a board and tell parents how they are run. Make sure that all poor children get free food at school. And the best of the most poor children in the country's best private schools should be spent. We need to reduce the size of the government substantially. For example, if we reduce the expenditure of the Balochistan government from Rs 900 billion to half, we can give Rs 15,000 a month to each of the 25 lakh families in Balochistan. This will change the economic, educational and political landscape of the province and the insurgency there will collapse in a couple of years.\"}, {\"title\": \"Representatives will be sent to the APC, will keep the stand on Balochistan, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari\", \"date\": \"2024-07-05\", \"location\": \"Balochistan\", \"relevant_features\": \"economic crisis, price rise\", \"content\": \"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that if a party conference (APC) is convened tomorrow on the commitment stability, will send its representatives and will keep the stand on Balochistan.

These views were expressed by the Prime Minister at a meeting of the Federal Cabinet on Tuesday. The Prime Minister said that the wave of terrorism has increased in the last few months. Terrorists targeted innocent Pakistanis in Dera Ismail Khan, Kirk and other areas. Terrorism incidents are highly condemnable. There is no doubt that the TTP terrorists are conducting operations from the Afghan soil, in this regard, the government of Pakistan has been informed by the Afghan government and effective operations have been carried out against the terrorists.

Most of the people were killed from Punjab. Immediately after these incidents, a campaign was launched against the Quetta hotels on social media and a campaign was launched by the Baloch college. It has been the tradition of the Baloch nation for centuries that they have never killed non -people, but Baloch literature has been filled with folk tales in which the enemies have also been given asylum. He put three thousand citizens of Balochistan, most of them, including teachers, students and journalists of the universities. The endless series of people has begun, which covers for more than two decades. The rulers never tried to resolve the issue seriously. The government approved the draft to declare the disappearance of civilians as a criminal offense, so it was revealed that the bill had gone missing. Earlier, the National Assembly passed the Criminal Law Employment Bill 2021 on November 8, 2021, and introduced a new clause in the Pakistan Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedures, according to which they would come under the guise of missing persons, who could not be abducted without any legal status. The disqualification of this bill not only caused a severe blow to the human rights activists, but also completely ignored the survival of the missing persons. It also made it clear that the problem of the missing persons was beyond the reach of political leadership. Some forces stopped this process from moving forward. On the other hand, neither industrial zones were ever created in Balochistan nor fisheries trade was encouraged. Most of the lives of Balochistan citizens are based on oil and other items coming from Iran. It should have been that this trade was given any legal form, but despite 77 years, this trade was not legalized and no organized program was created for the unemployed people of Balochistan. Frustrated by the political process, they are turning to the mountains. These elections not only put all the nationalist parties off the wall, but adding a new tradition to the political process, political leaders were defeated by contractors and mafia. In the recent election, three persons of the same family, including father, son and son -in -law, have been tried, which the locals do not even know. In today's 21st century, Pakistan is required to make Pakistan a strong and only nation in order to make different nations in the region a natural component of a federalism. That is, with the consent of Punjabi, Seraiki, Sindhi, Pashtuns and Balochs, their political problems should be resolved in such a way that 24 million people can call themselves Pakistani citizens. It should be remembered that till date all the insurgents from Balochistan have been resolved only and only through dialogue, even in recent months, the resolution of the sit -in of the Baloch Solidarity Committee under the leadership of Rang Baloch has been removed from the mutual dialogue.

Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, he said that the PTI was then out of such a big meeting on Pakistan's security issue. Imran Khan also refused to sit in his government at a security meeting with the opposition in his government, he was attacked by India or there was a major problem. He said that Imran Khan sowed the seeds during his tenure, which led to the martyrdom of our day every day in our destiny, neither did the policy nor the jet -black terrorists were settled in Pakistan, which were wanted in the world, and these conditions of today do not arise. Talal Chaudhry said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ali Amin Gundapur is making some statements about the same meeting, and is trying to create a confusion that the leadership of all the parties of Pakistan unanimously gave, in which the Chief Minister was present, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \\\"We will not allow any operation, I want to make it clear that there was no talk of launching a new operation, no new operation is going to happen,\\\" he said. The Minister of State for Home said that the new operation was being left only to create a confusion, with great clarity, the resolution stated that the National Action Plan and determination would be run, and it should be implemented, no new operation was discussed. He said that there are terrorist incidents in Pakistan and the governments of Pakistan and any institution of Pakistan are reluctant to say that if they do not want to take action, they do not need to say anything. Talal Chaudhry further said that Imran Khan had condemned the Jaffar Express incident a week later and made a statement and said that there was a failure of security forces and intelligence agencies. Intelligence agencies and security forces provide information, but Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are not capable of implementing the information given. He said that Balochistan has about 80 % of the B. Area, which has Levies, the attendance of these Levies is 45 %, leave that they have training and what weapons they have, where there is so much, no force, no police, no other security agencies, no security agencies. The Minister of State for Home said that it is the job of the army to open your roads, or that it is their job to arrive at the first time, when they come out, when matters are out of the bus from the rest of the security forces. He said that you repeatedly say that this is a failure of sensitive institutions, who give information to sensitive institutions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa? The CTD department is in the rented building, the meeting expressed that one percent of NFC has been going to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for the last 20 years. He said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a party government for the last 13 years, only to tell that out of this 800 billion rupees of Rs 8 billion on CTD or a police on the fight against terrorism, where did the money go? Talal Chaudhry said that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police are brave but they are fighting, they do not have a political Will, I am keeping one thing in full confidence that the Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa told some of his officers that there was no need to do anything, the ANP and the PPP did not fight against them. Talal Chaudhry said that he should come to the mosque or somewhere to say that he did not say, you want to discourage your officers to sympathize with these terrorists and stand with them so that you have no attacker, you never hurt your office, never talk to them. The Minister of State for Home added that Imran Khan has ever said that talks will bring peace, he should shoot and we should talk, talk is with those who do not have guns, who have guns in their hands, cannot be discussed. He said that the weapons can only talk about the weapons and that is happening in the same case, I want to present a few figures just to open their eyes to God. Talal Chaudhry said that there are about 9 terrorist incidents in Pakistan daily, on a daily basis, 3 law enforcement agencies are martyred, most of which are army people, and 7 are injured, 2 civilians are martyred daily and 4 days are injured. He further said that 1141 people were martyred or injured due to terrorism from January 1 to March 16, 1127 are from Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Tell me how Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan will not fight if terrorism will end. He said that the war would have to fight the provinces as the federal government and the army were fighting, the last time the war, which had been going on for a decade and a half, was successful when the political forces behind the law enforcement agencies stood with one language and a statement. He said that the same war was won in 17-2016 and the terrorists were defeated, the shortage is not in our forces. Talal Chaudhry said that it has been decided that everyone should fulfill their national duty, but no one will wait, this war will be fought and this war will be won, the voices coming from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa raise questions about your patriotism. He said that you do not condemn the banned BLA on the Jaffar Express attack, you only express regret, the attack on the Bannu Cantonment has happened while opening the fast, to this day, Imran Khan and PTI have not condemned it. Talal Chaudhry raised the question, how are you giving the impression? I am sorry to say this but the terrorist pattern is Imran Khan, neither will you condemn the banned BLA, nor will the banned TTP.\"}]",
         "The combination of ongoing terrorism and security challenges in Killa Abdullah is severely affecting stability and economic activities, as evident by disrupted train services and increased risks to food affordability, particularly with the rise in sugar prices. Although there are no direct reports of acute food shortages or specific negative coping mechanisms, such instability significantly constrains food accessibility and livelihoods.\n\nThe weather data indicates lower precipitation and high temperatures through the months leading up to the prediction period, which may affect local agricultural productivity and further exacerbate food availability issues.\n\nWhile nutrition and health infrastructure improvements show some attention to public health, the chronic insecurity, economic disruption, and limited mentions of migration suggest the district faces significant stressors consistent with IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), where food gaps emerge and reliance on crisis coping strategies is likely.",
